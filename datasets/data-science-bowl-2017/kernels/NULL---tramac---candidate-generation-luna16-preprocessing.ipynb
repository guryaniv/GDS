The segmented lungs can be further used to find the lung nodule candidates and regions of interest which may help in better classification of the CT Scans. Finding the lung nodule regions is a very hard problem because there are nodules that are attached to the blood vessels or are present at the boundary of the lung region. The lung nodule candidates can be further used for classification by cutting 3D voxels around them and passing it through a 3D CNNs which can be trained on LUNA16 dataset. The LUNA 16 dataset has the location of the nodules in each CT Scan thus will be useful for training the classifier. \n",

[Automatic segmentation of lung nodules with growing neural gas and support vector machine][1]- The proposed method consists of the acquisition of computerized tomography images of the lung, the reduction of the volume of interest through techniques for the extraction of the thorax, extraction of the lung, and reconstruction of the original shape of the parenchyma. After that, growing neural gas (GNG) is applied to constrain even more the structures that are denser than the pulmonary parenchyma (nodules, blood vessels, bronchi, etc.). The next stage is the separation of the structures resembling lung nodules from other structures, such as vessels and bronchi. Finally, the structures are classified as either nodule or non-nodule, through shape and texture measurements together with support vector machine.\n",

This 3D filter attempts to determine local geometrical characteristics for each voxel, computing the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix and evaluating a  \"likelihood\" function that was purposely built to discriminate between local morphology of linear, planar and spherical objects, modeled as having 3D Gaussian sections (Q. Li, S. Sone and K. Doi [6]). By applying this 3D filter to artificial images, we have verified the efficiency in detecting the Gaussian-like regions even in the cases were they are superimposed to non-Gaussian ones.\n",

        "whether the image contains a pulmonary lesion. As baselines, they also look at using SVM, kNN, and logistic regression to perform the same task. LIDC dataset is used for training and the classification results are very good.\n",
        " 2. [Pulmonary Nodule Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks on Computed Tomography Images][2]: They design a deep convolutional neural networks method for nodule classification, which has an advantage of autolearning representation and strong generalization ability. A specified network structure for nodule images is proposed to solve the recognition of three types of nodules, that is, solid, semisolid, and ground glass opacity (GGO). Deep convolutional neural networks are trained by 62,492 regions-of-interest (ROIs) samples including 40,772 nodules and 21,720 nonnodules from the Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC) database. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of sensitivity and overall accuracy and that it consistently outperforms the competing methods.\n",
        " 3. [Deep Learning for the Classification of Lung Nodules][3]: They have trained a CNN and tested the results on different datasets.  In order to understand the features of lung nodules, they further construct new datasets, based on the combination of artificial geometric nodules and some transformations of the original images, as well as a stochastic nodule shape model.\n",
        " 4. [Lung Nodule Classification Based on Deep Convolutional Neural Networks][4]: In this work, they present a method for classifying lung nodules based on CNNs. Training is performed by balancing the mini-batches on each stochastic gradient descent (SGD) iteration to address the lack of nodule samples compared to background samples. They show that the method outperforms a base feature-engineering method using the same techniques for other stages of lung nodule detection, and show that CNNs obtain competitive results.\n",
