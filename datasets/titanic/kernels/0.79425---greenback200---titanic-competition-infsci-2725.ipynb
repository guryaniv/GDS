Analyzing/Visualizing Data**\n\n  The goal of this section was to study the provided data to see if there were any strong trends or correlation between survival and another column.  Since we found that there were many different columns, we initially wanted our approach to be dropping extraneous noise and categorizing/grouping fields with a very wige range of values to hone in on strong trends.\n\n  We predicted that a few key traits would be very important to include in our prediction model.  Namely:\n  \n* Females would be more likely to survive than males\n* The higher the social class, the more likely the passenger would survive\n* Those with more family (parents, children, siblings, spouses) would have a higher rate of survival\n* The older a person is, the less likely they will survive\n* The younger a person is, the more likely they will survive\n\n  Not only do we set out to identify patterns within the data, but our goal is also to identify any flaws or traits the data has that will adversely affect the data and will subsequently require cleaning.  The way we approached analyzing data and identifying patterns was to look at relationships between columns from multiple perspectives.  For instance, perhaps you are more likely to survive as a higher class passenger than a lower class.  However, it is beneficial to look at total survival and demise sums to get an even better picture as to how strong the correlation is.  Lower class deaths dwarfed lower class survivals by an overwhelming amount, which would indicate that it is a *very* strong factor when predicting survival rates.","outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"c4005fcd-71f1-4bd3-a7cb-667a1da4e663","collapsed":true,"_uuid":"6ad8a435930209c2c348ab6f1d82a79cbb415f35","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Let's look at the two datasets to see what types of data are in each column and how many non-null values\n# make up each column.\n\nprint(train.info())\nprint(test.info())","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"d05cb91b-2e83-4e2e-99f1-ba89b6a430c0","collapsed":true,"_uuid":"36130c940bb63aa74d3f4679b50e5b33f2130a62","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"#It would also be helpful to take a look at a sampling of the data to see the actual values.\n\ntrain.sample(5)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b7a56091-75bf-4e40-af0a-9826a08f75da","collapsed":true,"_uuid":"64d49c5421718d8f575ebbe7b80f95b317721ca2","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"#\"Describing\" this data could give us a good idea of the general breakdown of each category.

Cleaning Data & Feature Engineering**\n\n  This portion is where things get interesting.  After analyzing the data, we have narrowed down the fields that we would like to hone in on.  These fields include:\n\n* Pclass    \n* Sex           \n* SibSp          \n* Parch          \n* Embarked              \n* Age\n\n  All of these present interesting patterns relative to the Survived data.  They have strong correlations that could be used for fairly accurate prediction models.  We believe Pclass is a good pick because of the strong correlation between class and survival, Sex because there are strong trends in females having high survival rates and males with low survival rates, SibSp and Parch because they add an interesting family dynamic where having around ~2 relatives seem to increase your chances of survival, Embarked because of its interesting and somewhat inexplicable relationship in survival rates, and Age because there is a broad distribution from child to senior citizen.\n  \n  We will look to categorize and group the values in a few of these columns.  For instance, instead of having a wide range of ages, we could set age categories that indicate if you are a child, an adult, or even a senior.  Similarly, we will look into names since they have titles to their names.  Titles can be used to predict behavior.  For instance, if the passenger has a military title, he may be more selfless and make sure civilians are safe before thinking of his or herself.  This might mean the military titles are less likely to survive.  Conversely, if the title indicates royalty, one would think they would be saved by any means possible due to their status, giving them a higher survival rate.\n\n  In cleaning the data, our first objective is to eliminate all null values.  We will impute the most statistically likely data in its place so as to maintain the integrity of the data.  Not only that, but many categorical columns will be re-formatted to numeric variables so that they can be used in statistics to make great predictions.  And finally, since we find some columns to be useless and do not hold any significant patterns or correlation, we will drop out everything irrelevant to cleanse the dataset so it can be run in different models with sound accuracy.","outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"507cd66a-f758-40dd-b17c-f326dc80ec76","collapsed":true,"_uuid":"1f99549c892b7a4cdfe6251cd731e1d584eff227","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"#To clean this data, we are going to want to start off by filling in all the null values for a more complete dataset.\n# We decided that the Cabin column provided no useful information and had far too many missing values\n# to really accurately impute realistic data.
