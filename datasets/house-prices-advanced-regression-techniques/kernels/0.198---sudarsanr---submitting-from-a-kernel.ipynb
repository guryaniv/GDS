In this step, you will learn to submit your model to a machine learning competition.  It's fun, and it will give you a way to see your progress as your skills keep improving.*\n\n# Introduction\nMachine learning competitions are a great way to improve your skills and measure your progress as a data scientist. If you are using data from a competition on Kaggle, you can easily submit it from your notebook.  Here's how you do it.\n\n# Example\nWe're doing very minimal data set up here so we can focus on how to submit modeling results to competitions. Other tutorials will teach you how build great models. So the model in this example will be fairly simple. We'll start with the code to read data, select predictors, and fit a model."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"58cfd95aa5563209575b12977280983ffeea6492","_cell_guid":"8524922d-be55-46fd-863f-004261fcfff0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor\n\n# Read the data\ntrain = pd.read_csv('../input/train.csv')\n\n# pull data into target (y) and predictors (X)\ntrain_y = train.SalePrice\npredictor_cols = ['LotArea', 'YearBuilt', '1stFlrSF', '2ndFlrSF', 'FullBath', 'BedroomAbvGr', 'TotRmsAbvGrd']\n\n# Create training predictors data\ntrain_X = train[predictor_cols]\n\nmy_model = RandomForestRegressor()\nmy_model.fit(train_X, train_y)","execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"c5294634157ca8c52d35c999ee949023b9544ee1","_cell_guid":"677b20af-bc56-4db1-aac3-1010389367ba"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In addition to your training data, there will be test data.

The prediction column will use the name of the target field.\n\nWe will create a DataFrame with this data, and then use the dataframe's `to_csv` method to write our submission file.

It will take some time for your kernel to run.  When it has finished your navigation bar at the top of the screen will have a tab for **Output**.  This only shows up if you have written an output file (like we did in the **Prepare Submission File** step).  \n\n---\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/hV9O90I.png)\n---\n\n# Last Steps \nClick on the Output button.  This will bring you to a screen with an option to **Submit to Competition**.  Hit that and you will see how your model performed.\n\nIf you want to go back to improve your model, click the Edit button, which re-opens the kernel.  You'll need to re-run all the cells when you re-open the kernel.\n\n# Conclusion\nYou've completed Level 1 of Machine Learning.  Congrats.  \n\nIf you are ready to keep improving your model (and your skills), start level 2 of [Learn Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/machine-learning). \n\nLevel 2 covers more powerful models, techniques to include non-numeric data, and more.  You can make more submissions to the competition and climb up the leaderboard as you go through the course.\n\n\n"}],"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.4","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
