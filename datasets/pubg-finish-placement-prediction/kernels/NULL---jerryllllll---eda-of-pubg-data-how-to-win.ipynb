Note: Self inflicted damage is subtracted.\n* **headshotKills** - Number of enemy players killed with headshots.\n* **heals** - Number of healing items used.\n* **Id** - Player’s Id\n* **killPlace** - Ranking in match of number of enemy players killed.\n* **killPoints** - Kills-based external ranking of player. (Think of this as an Elo ranking where only kills matter.) If there is a value other than -1 in rankPoints, then any 0 in killPoints should be treated as a “None”.\n* **killStreaks** - Max number of enemy players killed in a short amount of time.\n* **kills** - Number of enemy players killed.\n* **longestKill** - Longest distance between player and player killed at time of death. This may be misleading, as downing a player and driving away may lead to a large longestKill stat.\n* **matchDuration** - Duration of match in seconds.\n* **matchId** - ID to identify match. There are no matches that are in both the training and testing set.\n* **matchType** - String identifying the game mode that the data comes from. The standard modes are “solo”, “duo”, “squad”, “solo-fpp”, “duo-fpp”, and “squad-fpp”; other modes are from events or custom matches.\n* **rankPoints** - Elo-like ranking of player. This ranking is inconsistent and is being deprecated in the API’s next version, so use with caution. Value of -1 takes place of “None”.\n* **revives** - Number of times this player revived teammates.\n* **rideDistance** - Total distance traveled in vehicles measured in meters.\n* **roadKills** - Number of kills while in a vehicle.\n* **swimDistance** - Total distance traveled by swimming measured in meters.\n* **teamKills** - Number of times this player killed a teammate.\n* **vehicleDestroys** - Number of vehicles destroyed.\n* **walkDistance** - Total distance traveled on foot measured in meters.\n* **weaponsAcquired** - Number of weapons picked up.\n* **winPoints** - Win-based external ranking of player. (Think of this as an Elo ranking where only winning matters.) If there is a value other than -1 in rankPoints, then any 0 in winPoints should be treated as a “None”.\n* **groupId** - ID to identify a group within a match. If the same group of players plays in different matches, they will have a different groupId each time.\n* **numGroups** - Number of groups we have data for in the match.\n* **maxPlace** - Worst placement we have data for in the match. This may not match with numGroups, as sometimes the data skips over placements.\n* **winPlacePerc** - The target of prediction. This is a percentile winning placement, where 1 corresponds to 1st place, and 0 corresponds to last place in the match. It is calculated off of maxPlace, not numGroups, so it is possible to have missing chunks in a match.\n\nFrom the description, choose the below columns as most concerned features"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"e9725e6343b99d94ca4fde836e5ea26b28a70849","_kg_hide-input":false,"_kg_hide-output":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"features = list(train.columns)\nprint(features)\n\n#Based on player, so drop \"Id\", \"groupId\", \"matchId\", \"winPlacePerc\"\nfor i in [\"Id\",\"groupId\",\"matchId\",\"winPlacePerc\"]:\n    features.remove(i)\n    \nprint(features)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"88729151a7d4ce04e94c542cbea620a011c5d9fc"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As for the defination of the columns, we can  divide these features into following groups:\n\nkills:[damageDealt, DBNOs, headshotKills, killPlace, killPoints, kills, killStreaks, longestKill, roadKills]\n\nteamwork: [assists, revives]\n\nmed: [boosts, heals]\n\nmovement: [rideDistance, swimDistance, walkDistance]\n\nOthers: [maxPlace, numGroups, teamKills, vehicleDestroys, weaponsAcquired, winPoints]"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"bb72821d46e5503981b0ec370428bb1e8dfc1b3e"},"cell_type":"code","source":"kills = [\"damageDealt\", \"DBNOs\", \"headshotKills\", \"killPlace\", \"killPoints\", \"kills\", \"killStreaks\", \"longestKill\", \"roadKills\"]\nteamwork = [\"assists\", \"revives\"]\nmed = [\"boosts\", \"heals\"]\nmovement = [\"rideDistance\", \"swimDistance\", \"walkDistance\"]\nOthers = [\"maxPlace\", \"numGroups\", \"teamKills\", \"vehicleDestroys\", \"weaponsAcquired\", \"winPoints\"]\n\nprint(\"kills: \"+str(len(kills)))\nprint(\"teamwork: \"+str(len(teamwork)))\nprint(\"med: \"+str(len(med)))\nprint(\"movement: \"+str(len(movement)))\nprint(\"Others: \"+str(len(Others)))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"79e8ae79edef9cfbef699ea53c3401f4005085b0"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**2-1 Kills **\n\nLet's first see the relationship between Kills columns and winPlacePerc!"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"73b237a9baf93c9ba2a27f8d8b008b7a39f664a3"},"cell_type":"code","source":"data = train.copy()\nfor col in kills:\n    print(data[col].describe().drop(\"count\"))\n    print()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"a345c3e7123cdbd05e6e983ecba933f33b735edd"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"For kills data, commonly we will think about how many people I killed/knocked down.
