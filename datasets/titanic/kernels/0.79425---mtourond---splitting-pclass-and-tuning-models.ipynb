If something like the \"average\" of a feature has some meaning, it is usually a continuous variable. For example, we can interpret the mean age of passengers on the Titanic, therefore it is a continuous feature.\n2. If the \"average\" doesn't have a reasonable interpretation, it is usually a discrete variable. For example, can we really interpret the mean passenger class? Obviously, passenger class 2.3 doesn't have much meaning, you clearly cant be in Pclass 2.3. A more reasonable way to understand this feature would be to find the proportion of passengers in each Pclass. Therefore, it is a categorical feature.\n\nWe can see the following:\n\n* Surived is a categorical response variable\n* Pclass and Embarked are categorical features with 3 levels. Pclass however is an ordinal, which means that there is an \"order\" to the feature. Obviously, Pclass 1 > Pclass 2 > Pclass 3.

It's important to cross validate your results and be weary of overfitting. The prediction accuracy that your models have on your training set is usually not a very good indicator of how well it will perform on unseen data. Cross validation scores are an unbiased estimate of your models prediction accuracy that will aid in model selection.\n\n2. Most models have a wide variety of parameters that are given default values when you instantiate them. Generally want to adjust these parameters through either a grid search or a random search. A grid search exhaustively tries every combination of parameters that you add to the grid while a random search tests a random subset. I believe that random searches are generally better when you are not sure of roughly \"where\" the best parameters are. Also keep in mind that this parameter selectino can take quite a bit of time - on my laptop each gridsearch takes ~3 minutes while on my desktop with a i7 7700k it takes ~45 seconds.\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"effc9f28176240a36b772da34f534fcb0705c728"},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nfrom sklearn import tree\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\nfrom sklearn import svm\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import ExtraTreesClassifier\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import KFold\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_predict \nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\nfrom sklearn.feature_selection import f_regression\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"569e7dda7a70a5f0f6b193b3e0f3629c85824b68"},"cell_type":"code","source":"train_X=train.drop('Survived', axis=1)\ntrain_Y=train['Survived'].astype(int)\ntest_X=test\nKF=KFold(n_splits=10, random_state=1)\n\nmodels=[]\nmodelScores=[]\nmodelSTD=[]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"6861049ce06bdf73f520ead8e2694a8bf2992739"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"I won't go into too much detail about the individual models here.
