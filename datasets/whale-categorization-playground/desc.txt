After centuries of intense whaling, recovering whale populations still have a
hard time adapting to warming oceans and struggle to compete every day with
the industrial fishing industry for food. To aid whale conservation efforts,
scientists use photo surveillance systems to monitor ocean activity. They use
the shape of whales’ tails and unique markings found in footage to identify
what species of whale they’re analyzing and meticulously log whale pod
dynamics and movements. For the past 40 years, most of this work has been done
manually by individual scientists, leaving a huge trove of data untapped and
underutilized. In this competition, you’re challenged to build an algorithm to
identifying whale species in images. You’ll analyze Happy Whale’s database of
over 25,000 images, gathered from research institutions and public
contributors. By contributing, you’ll help to open rich fields of
understanding for marine mammal population dynamics around the globe. We'd
like to thank Happy Whale for providing this data and problem. Happy Whale is
a platform that uses image process algorithms to let anyone to submit their
whale photo and have it automatically identified.
