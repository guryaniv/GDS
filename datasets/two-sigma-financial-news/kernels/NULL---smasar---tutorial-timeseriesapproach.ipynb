WHAT MAKES TIME SERIES**\n\nAs the name suggests, TS is a collection of data points collected at constant time intervals. These are analyzed to determine the long term trend so as to forecast the future or perform some other form of analysis. But what makes a TS different from say a regular regression problem? There are 2 things:\n\n1. It is time dependent. So the basic assumption of a linear regression model that the observations are independent doesn’t hold in this case.\n2. Along with an increasing or decreasing trend, most TS have some form of seasonality trends, i.e. variations specific to a particular time frame. For example, if you see the sales of a woolen jacket over time, you will invariably find higher sales in winter seasons."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d081304d6e1f3e96f74f9999ab85d6195bfad74f"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"2\"></a> <br>\n**B.

So statisticians have figured out ways to make series stationary, which we’ll discuss now. Actually, its almost impossible to make a series perfectly stationary, but we try to take it as close as possible.\n\nLets understand what is making a TS non-stationary. There are 2 major reasons behind non-stationaruty of a TS:\n1. Trend – varying mean over time. For eg, in this case we saw that on average, the number of passengers was growing over time.\n2. Seasonality – variations at specific time-frames. eg people might have a tendency to buy cars in a particular month because of pay increment or festivals.\n\nThe underlying principle is to model or estimate the trend and seasonality in the series and remove those from the series to get a stationary series. Then statistical forecasting techniques can be implemented on this series. The final step would be to convert the forecasted values into the original scale by applying trend and seasonality constraints back.\n\nNote: I’ll be discussing a number of methods. Some might work well in this case and others might not. But the idea is to get a hang of all the methods and not focus on just the problem at hand.\n\nLet’s start by working on the trend part."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"50e0282655c2cc6340ac5254b07db58b4dcafdfb"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"10\"></a> <br>\n**E. ESTIMATING AND ELIMINATING TREND**\n\nOne of the first tricks to reduce trend can be transformation. For example, in this case we can clearly see that the there is a significant positive trend. So we can apply transformation which penalize higher values more than smaller values. These can be taking a log, square root, cube root, etc. Lets take a log transform here for simplicity:\n\n(ingore the interval that there is a no data)"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"d4fa04330c69bc48668360b4a7905199053b0ddf"},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig,axes = plt.subplots(1,1,figsize=(15,10))\naxes.set_title(\"Time Distro\")\naxes.set_ylabel(\"LOG(# of records)\")\naxes.set_xlabel(\"date\")\naxes.plot(time_series_df)\nts_log = np.log(time_series_df)\naxes.plot(ts_log)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"a5ac8b38c13d22f1427b28a4b0299699fc7beb4a"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In this simpler case, it is easy to see a forward trend in the data.

Polynomial Fitting – fit a regression model\n\nI will discuss smoothing here and you should try other techniques as well which might work out for other problems.

Forecasting TimeSeries**\n\nWe saw different techniques and all of them worked reasonably well for making the TS stationary. Lets make model on the TS after differencing as it is a very popular technique. Also, its relatively easier to add noise and seasonality back into predicted residuals in this case. Having performed the trend and seasonality estimation techniques, there can be two situations:\n\n1. A strictly stationary series with no dependence among the values. This is the easy case wherein we can model the residuals as white noise. But this is very rare.\n2. A series with significant dependence among values. In this case we need to use some statistical models like ARIMA to forecast the data.\n\nLet me give you a brief introduction to ARIMA. I won’t go into the technical details but you should understand these concepts in detail if you wish to apply them more effectively. ARIMA stands for Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Averages. The ARIMA forecasting for a stationary time series is nothing but a linear (like a linear regression) equation. The predictors depend on the parameters (p,d,q) of the ARIMA model:\n\n<a id=\"17\"></a> <br>\n1. INTRODUCTION TO ARIMA\n\nNumber of AR (Auto-Regressive) terms (p): AR terms are just lags of dependent variable. For instance if p is 5, the predictors for x(t) will be x(t-1)….x(t-5).\n\nNumber of MA (Moving Average) terms (q): MA terms are lagged forecast errors in prediction equation. For instance if q is 5, the predictors for x(t) will be e(t-1)….e(t-5) where e(i) is the difference between the moving average at ith instant and actual value.\n\nNumber of Differences (d): These are the number of nonseasonal differences, i.e. in this case we took the first order difference. So either we can pass that variable and put d=0 or pass the original variable and put d=1. Both will generate same results.\n\nAn importance concern here is how to determine the value of ‘p’ and ‘q’. We use two plots to determine these numbers. Lets discuss them first.\n\n<a id=\"18\"></a> <br>\n2. AUTOCORRELATION FUNCTION(ACF)\n\nIt is a measure of the correlation between the the TS with a lagged version of itself. For instance at lag 5, ACF would compare series at time instant ‘t1’…’t2’ with series at instant ‘t1-5’…’t2-5’ (t1-5 and t2 being end points). Partial \n\n<a id=\"19\"></a> <br>\n3. PARTIAL AUTOCORRELATION FUNCTION (PACF)\n\nThis measures the correlation between the TS with a lagged version of itself but after eliminating the variations already explained by the intervening comparisons. Eg at lag 5, it will check the correlation but remove the effects already explained by lags 1 to 4.\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"ea2a7b5c8ea892dafe189cd74998c2e51034ac3d"},"cell_type":"code","source":"#ACF and PACF plots:\nfrom statsmodels.tsa.stattools import acf, pacf\nlag_acf = acf(ts_log_diff, nlags=20)\nlag_pacf = pacf(ts_log_diff, nlags=20, method='ols')\n#Plot ACF: \nplt.subplot(121) \nplt.plot(lag_acf)\nplt.axhline(y=0,linestyle='--',color='gray')\nplt.axhline(y=-1.96/np.sqrt(len(ts_log_diff)),linestyle='--',color='gray')\nplt.axhline(y=1.96/np.sqrt(len(ts_log_diff)),linestyle='--',color='gray')\nplt.title('Autocorrelation Function')\n\n#Plot PACF:\nplt.subplot(122)\nplt.plot(lag_pacf)\nplt.axhline(y=0,linestyle='--',color='gray')\nplt.axhline(y=-1.96/np.sqrt(len(ts_log_diff)),linestyle='--',color='gray')\nplt.axhline(y=1.96/np.sqrt(len(ts_log_diff)),linestyle='--',color='gray')\nplt.title('Partial Autocorrelation Function')\nplt.tight_layout()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"2ecee97c2259fc5f20df712ac850e97f53a6ab38"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In this plot, the two dotted lines on either sides of 0 are the confidence interevals.

If you notice closely, in this case p=1.5\n2. q – The lag value where the ACF chart crosses the upper confidence interval for the first time.
