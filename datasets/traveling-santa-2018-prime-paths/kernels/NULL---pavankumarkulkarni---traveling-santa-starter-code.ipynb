A natural number greater than 1 that is not prime is called a composite number. For example, 5 is prime because the only ways of writing it as a product, 1 × 5 or 5 × 1, involve 5 itself. However, 6 is composite because it is the product of two numbers (2 × 3) that are both smaller than 6. Primes are central in number theory because of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic: every natural number greater than 1 is either a prime itself or can be factorized as a product of primes that is unique up to their order."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"61a30596aabbbddd040422d7610dcb42529dac38"},"cell_type":"code","source":"def is_prime(num):\n    if num > 1:\n        for i in np.arange(2, np.sqrt(num+1)) :\n            if num % i == 0:\n                return False\n        \n        return True\n    \n    return False","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"78529fdc90178e463611c3efc9e0f1f430bdc8ef"},"cell_type":"code","source":"cities['prime'] = cities['CityId'].apply(is_prime)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"e339035d8d68c56b3327f8b187e8f1b39dcc21ee"},"cell_type":"code","source":"sum(cities.prime)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"e2117f04d3a460dfd246c75dfca56b862ce50275"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"There are 197,769 cities out of which 17,802 are primes.
