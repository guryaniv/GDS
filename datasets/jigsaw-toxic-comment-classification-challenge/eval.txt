Update: Jan 30, 2018. Due to changes in the competition dataset, we have
changed the evaluation metric of this competition. Submissions are now
evaluated on the mean column-wise ROC AUC. In other words, the score is the
average of the individual AUCs of each predicted column. Submission File For
each id in the test set, you must predict a probability for each of the six
possible types of comment toxicity (toxic, severe_toxic, obscene, threat,
insult, identity_hate). The columns must be in the same order as shown below.
The file should contain a header and have the following format:
id,toxic,severe_toxic,obscene,threat,insult,identity_hate
00001cee341fdb12,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5
0000247867823ef7,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5 etc.
