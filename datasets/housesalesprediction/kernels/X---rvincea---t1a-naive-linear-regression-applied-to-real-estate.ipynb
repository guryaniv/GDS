The goal of this notebook is to apply linear regression to a real estate data set. I know there are many more interesting and 'fun' ML algorithms but linear regression is the only one known to me and I want to start with it because I understand the basics. On the way, I will explore some basic python and pandas. Here is my outline\n1. Some basics with analyzing data with Pandas (data manipulation and visualization)\n2. Creating sample 'linear' data\n3. Applying linear regression algorithms to my simply data (should work without issues, right? Right?)\n4. Finally, apply what I have learned to real estate data and see how we do."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"5439fd05-1f60-477d-a184-72e04d9a1a19","_uuid":"42409c441f38b433981ae52d488de0dc54335c36"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Step 1**\nWe will read in the same data (Real Estate prices - see data tab for description) and see how to use the various libraries to explore and graph the data.
