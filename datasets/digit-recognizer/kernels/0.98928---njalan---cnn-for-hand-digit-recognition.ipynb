Dense NN with Relu activation\n7. Dense NN with Softmax\n\nI used the Keras Sequential API, where you have just to add one layer at a time, starting from the input.\n\nThe first is the convolutional (Conv2D) layer. It is like a set of learnable filters. I choosed to set 8 filters for the first conv2D layers and 16 filters for second one. Each filter transforms a part of the image (defined by the kernel size) using the kernel filter. The kernel filter matrix is applied on the whole image. Filters can be seen as a transformation of the image.\n\nThe CNN can isolate features that are useful everywhere from these transformed images (feature maps).\n\nThe second important layer in CNN is the pooling (MaxPool2D) layer. This layer simply acts as a downsampling filter. It looks at the 2 neighboring pixels and picks the maximal value. These are used to reduce computational cost, and to some extent also reduce overfitting. We have to choose the pooling size (i.e the area size pooled each time) more the pooling dimension is high, more the downsampling is important. \n\nCombining convolutional and pooling layers, CNN are able to combine local features and learn more global features of the image.\n\nDropout is a regularization method, where a proportion of nodes in the layer are randomly ignored (setting their wieghts to zero) for each training sample. This drops randomly a propotion of the network and forces the network to learn features in a distributed way. This technique also improves generalization and reduces the overfitting. \n\n'relu' is the rectifier (activation function max(0,x). The rectifier activation function is used to add non linearity to the network. \n\nThe Flatten layer is use to convert the final feature maps into a one single 1D vector. This flattening step is needed so that you can make use of fully connected layers after some convolutional/maxpool layers. It combines all the found local features of the previous convolutional layers.\n\nIn the end, I used the features in two fully-connected (Dense) layers which is just a neural networks (NN) classifier.

We use a specific form for categorical classifications (>2 classes) called the \"categorical_crossentropy\".\n\nThe most important function is the optimizer. This function will iteratively improve parameters (filters kernel values, weights and bias of neurons ...) in order to minimise the loss. \n\nI choosed RMSprop (with default values), it is a very effective optimizer. The RMSProp update adjusts the Adagrad method in a very simple way in an attempt to reduce its aggressive, monotonically decreasing learning rate.\nWe could also have used Stochastic Gradient Descent ('sgd') optimizer, but it is slower than RMSprop.\n\nThe metric function \"accuracy\" is used is to evaluate the performance our model.\nThis metric function is similar to the loss function, except that the results from the metric evaluation are not used when training the model (only for evaluation)."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"57bceb43eff10ad7e77d5db8d2051b179d37b86b"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# defining an optimizer for the model\noptimizer = RMSprop(lr=0.001, rho=0.9, epsilon=1e-08, decay=0.0)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"2f450e45bcc83c42112f1923bd69eb5449b833fa"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Compile the model\nmodel.compile(optimizer = optimizer , loss = \"categorical_crossentropy\", metrics=[\"accuracy\"])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"2eb4ff3669c358ba3b6fb4ab9c612102ebcec3c4"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# train the model\nbatch_size = 100\nepochs = 30\nhistory = model.fit(X_train, Y_train, batch_size = batch_size, epochs = epochs, validation_data = (X_val, Y_val), verbose = 2)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"581ad32b0964b02dd0d183ebf03f34d75dbd9413"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Basic CNN result :** The accuracy I have got here on validation set (with batch_size = 100 and epoch = 10) is 99.52.
