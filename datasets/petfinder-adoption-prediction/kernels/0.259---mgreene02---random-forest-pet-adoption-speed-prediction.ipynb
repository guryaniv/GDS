The goal is to assign each pet a value from 1-4 which corresponds to the amount of time it takes to get adopted. The higher the number, the longer it takes. The full challenge can be found at this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/petfinder-adoption-prediction). Here I take a simple approach to defining features, joining multiple datasets, comparing a few different algorithms, and making predcitons based on the best models. Let's get started by importing all the right packages.\n\nI will include some factors from the the sentiment metadata, so I'll need a JSON package.
