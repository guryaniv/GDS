Submissions are evaluated using the multi-class logarithmic loss. Each image
has been labeled with one type. For each image, you must submit a set of
predicted probabilities (one for every category). The formula is then,
logloss=− 1 N ∑ i=1 N ∑ j=1 M y ij log( p ij ), where N is the number of
images in the test set, M is the number of categories, log is the natural
logarithm, (y_{ij}) is 1 if observation (i) belongs to class (j) and 0
otherwise, and p ij is the predicted probability that observation i belongs to
class j . The submitted probabilities for a given image are not required to
sum to one because they are rescaled prior to being scored (each row is
divided by the row sum). In order to avoid the extremes of the log function,
predicted probabilities are replaced with max(min(p,1− 10 −15 ), 10 −15 ) .
Submission File You must submit a csv file with the image id, and a
probability for each class. The order of the rows does not matter. The file
must have a header and should look like the following:
image_name,Type_1,Type_2,Type_3 0.jpg,0.1,0.3,0.6 1.jpg,0,0,1 ...
