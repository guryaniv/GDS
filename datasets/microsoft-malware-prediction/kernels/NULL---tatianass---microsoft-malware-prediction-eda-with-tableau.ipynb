Value refers to the feature distribution and how significant is the difference between the detection or not of a malware (HasDetection feature). Charts with (r) or (n) mean that, in my opinion, that feature should be removed , (i)  is for features that can be interest for the model. Meaning that charts with (r) have a very similar distribution when comparing to malwared detection. (n) for the variables with 50% or more missing values.\n\n**Number of features:** 83\n\n**Label:** HasDetections\n\n**(i)  - Total of 31 features: ** AppVersion, AVProductsEnabled, AVProductsInstalled, AVProductStatesIdentifier, AvSigVersion, Census_FirmwareVersionIdentifier, Census_IsAlwaysOnAlwaysConnectedCapable, Census_IsTouchEnabled, Census_IsVirtualDevice, Census_OEMModelIdentifier, Census_OEMNameIdentifier, Census_OSArchitecture, Census_OSBranch, Census_OSBuildRevision, Census_OSSkuName, Census_OSUILocaleIdentifier, Census_PrimaryDiskTotalCapacity, Census_ProcessorModelIdentifier, Census_SystemVolumeTotalCapacity, CityIdentifier, CountryIdentifier, EngineVersion, GeoNameIdentifier, IsSxsPassiveMode, LocaleEnglishNameIdentifier, OsBuildLab, OsPlatformSubRelease, Processor, ProductName, Wdft_IsGamer, Wdft_RegionIdentifier\n\n**(n) - 2:** Census_InternalBatteryType, Census_ProcessorClass\n\nThe rest is (r).\n\n* Please use the charts below to take your own conclusions and remember that this is an initial exploration.\n\nSadly, Kaggle is not showing the charts here, so follow [this link](https://public.tableau.com/views/malware/MicrosoftMalwarePrediction-EDA?:embed=y&:display_count=yes&publish=yes) to see them."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
