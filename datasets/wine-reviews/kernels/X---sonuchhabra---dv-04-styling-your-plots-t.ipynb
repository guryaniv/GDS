The defaults in `pandas` (and other tools) are rarely exactly right for the message you want to communicate. Tweaking your plot can greatly enhance the communicative power of your visualizations, helping to make your work more impactful.\n\nIn this section we'll learn how to style the visualizations we've been creating. Because there are *so many* things you can tweak in your plot, it's impossible to cover everything, so we won't try to be comprehensive here. Instead this section will cover some of the most useful basics: changing figure sizes, colors, and font sizes; adding titles; and removing axis borders.\n\nAn important skill in plot styling is knowing how to look things up. Comments like \"I have been using Matplotlib for a decade now, and I still have to look most things up\" are [all too common](https://youtu.be/aRxahWy-ul8?t=2m42s). If you're styling a `seaborn` plot, the library's [gallery](http://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/) and [API documentation](https://seaborn.pydata.org/api.html) are a great place to find styling options. And for both `seaborn` and `pandas` there is a wealth of information that you can find by looking up \"how to do X with Y\" on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) (replacing X with what you want to do, and Y with `pandas` or `seaborn`). If you want to change your plot in some way not covered in this brief tutorial, and don't already know what function you need to do it, searching like this is the most efficient way of finding it."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"32e4ed87-b33c-4fcc-94bd-489bf7ba52db","_uuid":"b4a6254a0222bdaa59461d2197ed169424412ceb","collapsed":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nreviews = pd.read_csv(\"../input/wine-reviews/winemag-data_first150k.csv\", index_col=0)\nreviews.head(3)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"06965bb1-79bd-41e1-80b7-b53a5483ad4b","_uuid":"e1eaac351ba2d3be32fe918411427ecce1385751"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Points on style\n\nRecall our bar plot from earlier:"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"807f652e-aee6-4eaa-87d3-bcfca78dc28b","_uuid":"96b86c77d2b1a7a8606b9db86520ed956e192923","collapsed":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"reviews['points'].value_counts().sort_index().plot.bar()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"cd16b490-72cb-429d-b0ab-58e7754d2c98","_uuid":"9e9569862ee66b0232e9ddd339a2a5904d5fcd4f"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Throughout this section we're going to work on making this plot look nicer.\n\nThis plot is kind of hard to see.
