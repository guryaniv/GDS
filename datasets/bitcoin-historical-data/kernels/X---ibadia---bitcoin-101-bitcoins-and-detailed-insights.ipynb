Where you will put it?, in a wallet right, just like that in Bitcoin wallets you put bitcoins but difference is that bitcoin wallet is digital.\n<br>\n\nBut there is a problem, How can you ensure that ONLY you can access 100 dollar note in your wallet and no one else. \n\n<b> To solve the above mentioned problem lets start from the beginning and see  how bitcoin wallet is created. </b>\n<br>\n\n\n<b> How you got to the address, your public bitcoin address.</b>\n<br>\n<b> How a wallet is created?</b>\n<br>\nLets understand how a wallet is created and how it ensures that only you have access to the bitcoins you have\n<br>\nHere are three keywords you need to remember Private_key, Public_key, and Bitcoin_address.\n\n\n<b>Step 1:</b>\n<br>\nFirst of all you get a fixed length of random characters its called PRIVATE_KEY. You need to keep it hidden and dont have to give it to anyone else.  \n<br>\n<br>\n<b> Step 2:</b>\n<br>\nNow that you have a private key what you need to do is pass this private_key to a function. This is a special function which will give you a new key, lets name it Public Key.  \n<br>\n<br>\npublic_key=FUNCTION(private_key)\n\nWe will skip how a function is implemented. To know how it is implemented we need to understand cry.\n\n<br>\nBut the point to notice is that it is a <b>one way function</b> and there is no practical way to get  private_key from public key.\n<br>\n\n<b> Step 3</b>\n<br>\nNow that you have two things <b>Private_key</b> and <b>public_key</b>.\nWhat we will do now is pass the public_key to another function which gives us another key. Lets name it <b>address</b>.\n<br>\n<b> ADDRESS= Some_other_function(public_key)</b>\n\nNow Address is something that you can give to anyone.\nIf you want anyone to transfer some money intor your wallet  you will provide him this ADDRESS.\n\nWhat wallet stores is your private_address and unspent outputs, we will undertand the unspent outputs in the next section.\n\nNow the question which arises over here how can we use private_key, public_key and address to transfer money and ensure safety of your wallet.\n\n<b>Summary</b><br>\nSo here are few points if you missed anything, you had a private key: a random characters of fixed length, you passed it to a function to get a public key which was passed again to a function to get address. These functions are one way function which means if\na=function(b)\nthen there is no practical way to find <b>b</b> if you know <b>a</b>.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a id='2'></a>\n## Transactions:\n<br>\nIn this section we will understand how is bitcoins put in a wallet and how can only the wallet holder spends it and how it is transferred.\n<a id='2.1'></a>\n### How transaction works in a NUTSHELL?\nIn transactions there is a concept of input and outputs. \n\nIn bitcoins each transaction have a number of inputs and outputs.\nIn this scenario there are three people: IBAD, READER(you) and amazon\n\nNow lets say you want to buy a nice watch. \nSo you go to the ecommerce website and it says to transfer 1 bitcoin to their address to get a watch.\n\nSo you will do is open your wallet and transfer 1 btc to Amazon (ecommerce website) to get a watch.\n\n\nUnfortunately you have no bitcoins.\n\nSo you came to me and asked me to transfer 100btc to your address and you provide me your \"address\" you made in the previous section.\nRECALL:    address=Function(public_key)\n                  public_keye=Function(private key)\n                  private key= \"Random Characters of Fixed Length\" Must be kept hidden\n\nWhat is going to happen is this that I will write a transaction and it will look something like this. \n\n<b>TRANSACTION#1 by Ibad:</b><br>\n<b>INPUT:</b> Hey miner, I have 1000 bitcoins, Want a proof?. look at OUTPUT#2762\n\n<b><a id='output123'>OUTPUT#123:</a></b>\nHey Miner,  This is for the reader, he can spent 100 Bitcoins\n\n<b><a id='output124'>OUTPUT#124:</a></b>\nHey Miner, This is for ME, I must be able to spent 900 Bitcoins\n\nI had 1000 bitcoins, I transferred 100 to you, and got 900 change back to myself.\n.\nNow after writing this transaction I send it to the bitcoin network, After some times a MINER sees this transactions, Validates it(checks it) just like the banker checks your cheque for forgery and approves it. Once approved this transaction will be marked as Confirmed and you can now spend your 100 bitcoins. \n\n\nNow that you have 100 bitcoins now So you want to buy that watch from amazon so what you are going to do is write a transaction.\n\n<b>TRANSACTION#2 by READER:</b>\n<br>\n<b>INPUT:</b> Hey miner, I have 100 bitcoins, Want a proof?.  look at <a href='#output123'>OUTPUT#123</a>\n\n\n<b>OUTPUT#125: </b>\nHey Miner, This is for the amazon, they can spend 1 Bitcoin.\n\n<b><a id='output126'>OUTPUT#126:</a></b>\nHey Miner, This is for me(reader)(you)(as it is written by you hence i am using me), I must be able to spend 99 Bitcoins.\n\nYou had 100 bitcoins you sent 1 bitcoin to amazon and got 99 back to you.\n\n#### Now  <a href='#output123'>OUTPUT#123</a>  is  SPENT OUTPUT\n\n####  <a href='#output126'>OUTPUT#126</a> is unspent output\n\n#### <a href='output124'>Output#124</a> is unspent output.\n\n\nFor the next time if you want to do another transaction you will reference <a href='#output126'>Output#126</a> in your INPUT.\n\n\n\n\n<a id='2.3'></a>\n## SAMPLE TRANSACTION:\nLets look at a sample input and sample output and lets see how they help in transactions.\n\nTo make it simple assume there are two people you and me, Now you have some bitcoins with you and want to transfer some of it to me. \n\n<b>Scenario:</b> You want to transfer me <b>0.04</b> bitcoins to me.\n<br>\nYou currently have: <b>0.06</b> bitcoins.\n\n\nLet take a look at sample transaction input First and understand what does it implies.\n","outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_uuid":"e6e0789fc9f1d235f4b5ae4ceef3fb1b28adcab6","_cell_guid":"eef29855-dc1d-4c2b-b394-6386cb5972af","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"x=test_data.iloc[2].inputs[0]\nx[\"input_pubkey_base58\"]=\"1KEH32noJFb3tiBbWzLZo9nie6C4VhNP7Y\"\nprint (x)\n#MODIFIED THE INPUT BECAUSE HEAD VALUE KEEPS ON CHANGING","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"c06e689fc77b0d86531dd7ca54368924c350f05a","_cell_guid":"76f8f4b9-6d68-4f3e-a1ee-ccb2cf3e59e5"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"There are total of 6 properties over here, we will consider only those that are important to get the basic idea.\nThe first property \"input_pubkey_base58\" is your ADDRESS which in this case is: <b>1KEH32noJFb3tiBbWzLZo9nie6C4VhNP7Y</b>\n\nThe property \"input_script_string\" contains the reference to previous unspent output from where you are spending.\n\n\ninputs are just there for referencing the previous unspent outputs.\n\nNow lets look at the output for this transaction.","outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_uuid":"9746dd683b35684101d5442ee5615bb555ef30fc","_cell_guid":"3599bffb-652e-40ab-9edf-a8ccca5324ce","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"x=test_data.iloc[3].outputs[0]\nx[\"output_satoshis\"]=4000000\nx[\"output_pubkey_base58\"]=\"1bonesF1NYidcd5veLqy1RZgF4mpYJWXZ\"\nprint (x)\nprint (\"-\"*0)\nx[\"output_satoshis\"]=1159000\nx[\"output_pubkey_base58\"]=\"1KEH32noJFb3tiBbWzLZo9nie6C4VhNP7Y\"\nprint (x)\n#MODIFIED THE INPUT BECAUSE HEAD VALUE KEEPS ON CHANGING","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"958dae544e9e6196c919431ba88596690be30e41","_cell_guid":"4538e071-3864-4b78-8fc5-3c5ff61da448"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Recall from above that your address is: 1KEH32noJFb3tiBbWzLZo9nie6C4VhNP7Y\n\nHere we can see there are two outputs.\n\noutput_satoshis is the amount of bitcoins you are sending.
