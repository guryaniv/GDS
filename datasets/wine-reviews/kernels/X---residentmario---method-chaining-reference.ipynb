It is also the only section of this tutorial which is a technique or a pattern, not a function or variable.\n\nMethod chaining is a methodology for performing operations on a `DataFrame` or `Series` that emphasizes continuity. To demonstrate what I mean, here's a data cleaning and dropping operation (which you should be familiar with from the last section) done two different ways:"},{"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"trusted":false,"_uuid":"e62026881fcedff546aceda4363aff1fdfe8157c"},"cell_type":"code","source":"stars = ramen['Stars']\nna_stars = stars.replace('Unrated', None).dropna()\nfloat_stars = na_stars.astype('float64')\nfloat_stars.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"trusted":false,"_uuid":"1c24d55bdba17890d1ad5c71b60bdb085f551c5f"},"cell_type":"code","source":"(ramen['Stars']\n     .replace('Unrated', None)\n     .dropna()\n     .astype('float64')\n     .head())","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8aa1cf57c4503a6bec38c5af02976bd89d835ccb"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In the first statement we assign data to temporary variables, creating new ones as we go further and further along. In the second statement, written in the method chaining style, we instead \"chain\" our operations, one after the other, all on the same original `DataFrame`.\n\nMost `pandas` operations can written in a method chaining style, and in the last couple years or so `pandas` has added more and more tools for making these sorts of statements easier to write. This paradigm comes to us from the R programming language&mdash;specifically, the `dpyler` module, part of the \"Tidyverse\".\n\nMethod chaining is advantageous for several reasons. One is that it lessens the need for creating and mentally tracking temporary variables. Another is that it emphasizes a correctly structured interative approach to working with data, where each operation is a \"next step\" after the last. Debugging is easy: just comment out operations that don't work until you get to one that does, and then start stepping forward again. And it looks kind of cool. =)\n\nFor a deeper exploration of why method chaining, read the [Method Chaining Section of the Modern Pandas Tutorial](https://tomaugspurger.github.io/method-chaining.html) (written by a `pandas` core dev)."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"0f8fcb6d922ca7822074e4e4ef85cb23174cf36f"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Assign and pipe\n\nNow that we've learned all these ways of manipulating data with `pandas`, we're ready to take advantage of method chaining to write clear, clean data manipulation code.

The `assign` method lets you create new columns or modify old ones inside of a `DataFrame` inline.
