Scoring Metric Submissions are evaluated using the Normalized Gini
Coefficient. During scoring, observations are sorted from the largest to the
smallest predictions. Predictions are only used for ordering observations;
therefore, the relative magnitude of the predictions are not used during
scoring. The scoring algorithm then compares the cumulative proportion of
positive class observations to a theoretical uniform proportion. The Gini
Coefficient ranges from approximately 0 for random guessing, to approximately
0.5 for a perfect score. The theoretical maximum for the discrete calculation
is (1 - frac_pos) / 2. The Normalized Gini Coefficient adjusts the score by
the theoretical maximum so that the maximum score is 1. The code to calculate
Normalized Gini Coefficient in a number of different languages can be found in
this forum thread. Submission File For each id in the test set, you must
predict a probability of an insurance claim in the target column. The file
should contain a header and have the following format: id,target 0,0.1 1,0.9
2,1.0 etc.
