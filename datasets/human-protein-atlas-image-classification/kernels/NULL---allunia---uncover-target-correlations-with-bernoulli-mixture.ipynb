As I'm currently on the way of my learning path to discover mixture models the choice using a Bernoulli mixture model was an easy one.  What's the idea behind it?\n\n*If you are not interested in mixture models and math etc. skip this chapter and jump to results analysis ;-) *\n\nMixture models assume that the data we **observed $X$ was generated by some latent variable $Z$.** In our case this could be the **staining process** of microscope preparates used to obtain the 4 channel images. Perhaps this process is limited and this limitation has caused our target groupings. You have already seen that we were able to reduce the number of target classes by fusing endosomes and lysosomes. Consequently we can say that there are fewer configurations of the latent variable than target classes. \n\n\n### Model description\n\nThese configurations can be seen as $K$ components of the mixture model. We don't know how many of them are actually there and we will have to estimate them during the analysis. Each component tries to explain one target group we are seeking for. And for each sample $x_{n}$ of our $N$ data spots there exists a related latent or hidden variable $z_{n}$ that holds 1 for the component $k$ that generated $x_{n}$ and 0 for all others. Imagine you would already know them, then we could describe the probability density our data as follows:\n\n$$ P(X) = \\sum_{Z} P(X, Z|\\theta |\\theta) = \\sum_{Z} P(Z|\\theta) \\cdot P(X|Z, \\theta)$$\n\nIf you are not very familiar with probabilities: To obtain this equation you need to know the sum and product rules of probabilites. We are now summing over all $K$ configurations of the latent variable Z, hence over $K$ assumed clusters. This formulation is very general. Now image you take a look at one of the components, on one single cluster. How is the target protein data distributed in that group?\n\n<a title=\"Classical Numismatic Group, Inc. http://www.cngcoins.com [GFDL (http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html), CC-BY-SA-3.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/) or CC BY-SA 2.5 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5)]\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ephesos_620-600_BC.jpg\"><img width=\"256\" alt=\"Ephesos 620-600 BC\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/Ephesos_620-600_BC.jpg\"></a>\n\nEach target protein $x_{d}$ itself is binary. If we like to describe the distribution of nucleoplasmn it is like one we would obtain by tossing a coin. And for each of the $D=28$ target protein we could flip such a coin, with zero on one side and one on the other. If we assume that  the target proteins are independent within one component $k$ than we can write:\n\n$$ p(x_{n}|\\mu_{k}) = \\prod_{d=1}^{D} \\mu_{k,d}^{x_{n,d}} (1-\\mu_{k,d})^{(1-x_{n,d})}$$\n\nWhereas $\\mu_{k,d}$ stands for the probability to observe the current target protein $x_{n,d}$. This sounds difficult first but let's try to understand it with lysosomes and endosomes again: If we know that they belong to group component $k=2$, for example. Then the probability to observe lysosomes and endosomes within this group could perhaps be $\\mu_{2,lyso} = \\mu_{2,endo} =  0.99$ for both and $\\mu_{2,ER} = 0.4$ for endoplasmatic reticulum. For all other proteins the probability to observe them should be very low, for example $\\mu_{2, k} = 0.01.$ If we now have a sample that fits to this target combination it would yield a high value for $p(x_{n}| \\mu_{2})$. Hence it's probable that it belongs to that group.\n\nOk, we are close to fullfill our model decription. We try to explain our data by the probability density $P(X)$. Imagine that all samples were independently drawn from this distribution. With this assumption we can split into a product over all $N$ samples. \n\n$$ P(X) = \\sum_{Z} P(X, Z|\\theta) = \\sum_{Z} P(Z|\\theta) \\cdot P(X|Z, \\theta) = \\prod_{n} \\sum_{z} p(z|\\pi) \\cdot p(x|z, \\mu)$$\n\nAs there exists one true component $z_{n,k}$ for each sample, we can say that $z_{n}$ is one-hot-encoded and can be described by a multinomial distribution:\n\n$$p(z|\\pi) = \\prod_{k=1}^{K} \\pi_{k}^{z_{k}}$$\n\nThe same holds for the conditional probability $p(x|z, \\mu)$:\n\n$$p(x|z, \\mu) = \\prod_{k=1}^{K} p(x|\\mu_{k})^{z_{k}}$$\n\nand finally we obtain: \n\n$$ P(X) = \\prod_{n} \\sum_{z} p(z|\\pi) \\cdot p(x|z, \\mu)  = \\prod_{n} \\sum_{k}^{K} \\pi_{k} \\cdot p(x_{n}|\\mu_{k}) = \\prod_{n} \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\pi_{k} \\cdot \\prod_{d=1}^{D} \\mu_{k,d}^{x_{n,d}} (1-\\mu_{k,d})^{(1-x_{n,d})} $$\n\nWith this model we like to describe our target data. And to make this model fit to what we observe we will maximize this probability density $p(X)$ with respect to our model parameters $\\pi$ and $\\mu$. This maximization is usually performed by taking the log first as it often makes it simpler to take derivarives. But in our case we will stuck....\n\n$$ \\ln p(X|\\mu, \\pi) = \\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\ln \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\pi_{k} \\cdot p(x_{n}|\\mu_{k}) \\right) $$ \n\nDo you see the problem? The sum over all $K$ components prevents the log to act on $\\pi_{k} \\cdot p(x_{n}|\\mu_{k})$ and consequently we can't make the bernoullis tractable for taking derivatives. :-(  "},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","collapsed":true,"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":false},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Expectation maximization\n\n$$ \\ln p(X,Z|\\mu, \\pi) = \\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\gamma (z_{n,k}) \\left( \\ln \\pi_{k} + \\sum_{d=1}^{D} x_{n,d} \\ln \\mu_{k,d} + (1- x_{n,d}) \\ln (1-\\mu_{k,d}) \\right)$$\n\nNow the hero comes: Instead of maximizing the log-likelihood we are going to act as if we already know our parameters $\\pi_{k}$ and $\\mu_{k}$ by initializing them randomly.  \n\n#### E-Step: responsibilites\n\nThen we compute how responsible each component of our mixture $k$ was to generate the data spot $x_{n}$ and its targets.

If you take a look at the probability $\\mu$ for Aggresomes in that cluster it's quite low with 18. Perhaps this cluster is not nice shaped and occupied. We don't know, how many nucleoplasmn targets come alone in that cluster or how many are coupled with aggresomes. Let's make a map for this case: "},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"d32aea578cf8c0e20b0d7b124c64fe7b394b43eb","_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"aggresome_cluster = results.loc[results.cluster==1].drop([\"cluster\",\n                                 \"cluster_names\",\n                                 \"number_of_targets\", \n                                  \"anomaly\", \n                                 \"certainty\"], axis=1).copy()\n\ncounts = aggresome_cluster.sum()\ncolumns_of_interest = list(counts[counts>0].index.values)\naggresome_cluster = aggresome_cluster.loc[:,columns_of_interest]\n\naggresome_combinations = pd.DataFrame(index=aggresome_cluster.columns.values,\n                                      columns=aggresome_cluster.columns.values)\n\nfor col in aggresome_combinations.columns:\n    aggresome_combinations.loc[col,:] = aggresome_cluster[aggresome_cluster[col] == 1].sum()\n\nmask = np.zeros_like(aggresome_combinations, dtype=np.bool)\nmask[np.triu_indices_from(mask, k=1)] = True\n\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(8,8))\nsns.set(style=\"white\")\nsns.heatmap(aggresome_combinations, mask=mask, cmap=\"Reds\",\n            square=True, linewidths=.5, cbar_kws={\"shrink\": .5}, vmin=0, vmax=50, annot=True, fmt=\"g\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"82340fcfe22eb27aec94a2ce1abbf91c590cf1b8"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Take-Away\n\n* Ok, a lot of aggresomes seem to come alone as they have a lot of counts with themselves but only few counts for other target proteins.\n* Samples with two targets present are probably given by Nucleoplasmn-Aggresome combinations as this is the second highest count in the map.\n* By only considering the aggresome row we can see that there are some samples that are coupled with cytokinetic bridge or cell junctions with have themselves some couplings with the nucleoplasm.

One example: Take a look at the aggresome row again and the microtubule organizing center column. You can see that there are zero couplings of aggresomes with this target. But you can see that the organizing center has couplings with cell junctions and nucleoplasmn. Consequently some of the 2- or 3-couplings could be given by such combinations without aggresomes.
