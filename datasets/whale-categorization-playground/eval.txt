Submissions are evaluated according to the Mean Average Precision @ 5 (MAP@5):
MAP@5= 1 U ∑ u=1 U ∑ k=1 min(n,5) P(k) where U is the number of images, P(k)
is the precision at cutoff k, and n is the number predictions per image.
Submission File For each Image in the test set, you may predict up to 5 labels
for the whale Id. Whales that are not predicted to be one of the labels in the
training data should be labeled as new_whale. The file should contain a header
and have the following format: Image,Id 00029b3a.jpg,new_whale w_1287fbc
