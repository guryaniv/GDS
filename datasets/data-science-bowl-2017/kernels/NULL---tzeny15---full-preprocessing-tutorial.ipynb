If that sounds like a lot of work, we found this to be around 0.25 in the LUNA16 competition. \n\n**Warning: Do not zero center with the mean per image (like is done in some kernels on here). The CT scanners are calibrated to return accurate HU measurements. There is no such thing as an image with lower contrast or brightness like in normal pictures.**"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"3570abfa-b13a-bd5b-06f3-9fd9a4329b1d","_uuid":"07ca281c5e8fa59f5d14afba48eecb00eb77da20","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"PIXEL_MEAN = 0.25\n\ndef zero_center(image):\n    image = image - PIXEL_MEAN\n    return image","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"17e813c3-6388-1956-47a2-24bb54376142","_uuid":"c8fbd84bdf432a7484404881c9ccc3ef68e56c20"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# What's next? \n\nWith these steps your images are ready for consumption by your CNN or other ML method :). You can do all these steps offline (one time and save the result), and I would advise you to do so and let it run overnight as it may take a long time. \n\n**Tip:** To save storage space, don't do normalization and zero centering beforehand, but do this online (during training, just after loading). If you don't do this yet, your image are int16's, which are smaller than float32s and easier to compress as well.\n\n**If this tutorial helped you at all, please upvote it and leave a comment :)**"}],"metadata":{"_change_revision":0,"_is_fork":false,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
