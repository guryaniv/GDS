During their discussion, Santa revealed that the every-ten-cities designation is important to him since he collects cookies at each city and then only eats them every-10th city for efficiency (it takes some time to get the crumbs out of his beard).  In addition, the accompanying Elves take a brief rest break at the 10th city (as specified in the Elf-Union contract.) If the city before the 10th city has carrots (is prime) Santa grabs the carrots and gives them to the Reindeer to eat on the 10th city while he and the Elves take their break.\n\n\nWith these new details the Reindeer proposed an alternate algorithm:<br>\n** * Find the shortest path that has EVERY prime city occuring just before a 10th city* ** <br>\n(Actually, it's on every 10th city if the NP is counted as city 1.).<br>\nIn this way the Reindeer will get all the carrots that have been left for them.  The Reindeer understand that not every 10th city will have carrots (17802 carrot cities vs 19776 10th cities), but, as long as Santa's path gets them all the available carrots they have agreed to work full speed between all cities charging no penalty.\n\n**With the results below (v7), the Reindeer propose a \"two-loop\" path:<br>\nAfter leaving the North Pole, they are excited and energized and will do 19740 cities at top speed with no carrots. <br>\nThen for the rest of the night, the path will get them All the Carrots with carrots at each 10th city. <br>\nThe total travel length is 2374798 . For reference its Rudolph Score is 2377086 (from a penalty fraction of 0.09 %)**\n<br>"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"7e1e137c10790431d11062696cc387013f477a1e"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Notes/Diary:\nThis kernel borrows from the Theo Viel's\n[\"Greedy Reindeer\"](https://www.kaggle.com/theoviel/greedy-reindeer-starter-code). <br>\n\"Backbone\" input files are made with a **companion kernel**:\n[Concorde - Primes only](https://www.kaggle.com/dan3dewey/concorde-primes-only) <br>\nwhich is based on William Cukierski's \n[\"Concorde solver\"](https://www.kaggle.com/wcukierski/concorde-solver) kernel. <br>\n\n**General Approach...** Given that the path will include all prime cities at 1/10th-city locations, one way to determine the path is by answering these questions (perhaps iteratively): <br>\ni) Which other cities will also be at 1/10th-city locations? , e.g. to make a complete backbone. <br>\nii) How to determine the order of the backbone cities along the backbone? <br>\niii) Which 9 cities are assigned to each backbone segment? , i.e., which 9 cities are put between backbone-adjacent 1/10th-cities?<br>\niv) How is the path-order of the 9 cities within a segment decided? <br>\n\n* 7 Dec 2018: (v1) Start exploring this idea using a Concorde-TSP NP+primes-only path as a backbone and adding (inserting) 9 cities before each prime city and return to the North Pole. The resulting path of 178021 cities does have primes at every 10th city scoring no additional penalty. (Of course this path does not have all the cities on it.)<br>\n* 8 Dec 2018: (v2) Determine and include the proper number of cities (9) on the segment from the last backbone city back to the NP so that the remaining number of un-connected cities is a multiple of 10. Select 1/10 of these to add to the prime backbone and write out a csv file that is the new, full backbone (i.e., has enough additional backbone cities to be able to make a penalty-free path that incudes all of the cities.)  Use this new backbone list as input to the\n[Concorde - Primes only](https://www.kaggle.com/dan3dewey/concorde-primes-only) kernel(v5)\nto output the full backbone in an optimum TSP order, this full backbone itself has length 382762. <br>\n* 9 Dec 2018: (pre-v3) Use the new full backbone to generate an All-Carrots path - it worked getting all 17802 Carrots. However, the Rudolph score is 8284825 from a total Length of: 8266128\nThe 'answers' to the General Approach questions used at this point are: i) randomly pick 1/10th of 'remaining' cities (cities not assigned to a primes-only TSP backbone). ii) Backbone cities are put in TSP solution order. iii) For each segment, select/assign he 9 (remaining) cities that are closest to the midpoint of the backbone segment. iv) keep segment cities in their selected order.\n* 11 Dec 2018: Setup a \"backbone database\" to capture useful information about the backbone and path. Use a little better full-backbone TSP solution (from \"Primes only\" (v7) with t_bound = 5000). <br>\n* 11-15 Dec 2018: (v3) Implement a sequential insertion scheme to order the 9 cities within each backbone segment. <br>\nIt might speed things up to use the efficient code developed in hirune924's kernel: [Random Insertion (No Concord Solver Solution)\n](https://www.kaggle.com/hirune924/random-insertion-no-concord-solver-solution)  ;-) <br>\n* 15 Dec 2018: Apply the sequential insertion scheme to the segments. Some very large MaxRadius values... Start again with the t5000 primes only TSP to see how that is (without the remaining non-prime cities.) Does reasonably well, length = 2284014. This suggests that including the additional 19740 cities, if they had similar efficiency, would give a length increased by a factor (19740+178030)/(178030), or 1.111, for a total length around 2540000.\n* 16 Dec 2018: (v4) Did a TSP (\"Concorde - Primes only\" kernel) on the \"Remaining cities\" left after the primes-only backbone was used. Combined 1/10th of these with the Primes and NP to form a complete backbone (TSP'ed) that should better include all the cities... But still many large spacings are needed, length ~ 4300000.\n* 17-19 Dec 2018: Since a full path has to use all the cities, experimenting with less than 9 cities per segment shows that the problem (length) comes when getting to the last bb cities and having to pick segment-cities that are scattered and far away. <br>\nTry to reduce this problem by doing things like: adding one city at a time to each backbone segment, and then add a second to each, etc. Could also do the backbone cities going from least to most dense... Since the backbone may not be constructed and filled in in path order, generate the final path after-the-fact from the bb dataframe. To allow cities for each segment to be added incrementally, keep/update the CityListStr values in the dfbb (v5). <br>\n* 20 Dec 2018: Include information in the dfbb based on each segment in isolation (RadAlone, LenAlone) and write it to a csv file (to speed further processing.) Filling the prime backbone segments and then the non-prime ones mimics the way that non-prime backbone cities were chosen. <br>\nGets all 17802 carrots with a Rudolph score and Length of 2993490 and 2983638 (v6).<br>\n* 21 Dec 2018: **What if the Reindeer did (essentially) two loops?** One with all primes cities and one with the remaining cities? All primes has length/score of 2151297.  Put the 19740 remaining cities into TSP order (include NP too) with Concorde... that has length ~ 220000. <br>\nSo all together the complete path length is 2374798 (Rudolph score 2377086) - the best \"All the Carrots\" path so far ;-)  (v7)\n* 26-27 Dec 2018: Look into ways to improve the Primes path (this will change the Remaining): i) limiting distance sequentially across all segements; ii) using the Centroid of exisiting path to calculate distances; iii) do the Compact cities in stages to take advantage of the centroid; iv) adjust compact city selection ratio for best length. <br>\nGot down to **2208262**.
