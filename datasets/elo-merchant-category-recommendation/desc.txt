Imagine being hungry in an unfamiliar part of town and getting restaurant
recommendations served up, based on your personal preferences, at just the
right moment. The recommendation comes with an attached discount from your
credit card provider for a local place around the corner! Right now, Elo, one
of the largest payment brands in Brazil, has built partnerships with merchants
in order to offer promotions or discounts to cardholders. But do these
promotions work for either the consumer or the merchant? Do customers enjoy
their experience? Do merchants see repeat business? Personalization is key.
Elo has built machine learning models to understand the most important aspects
and preferences in their customers’ lifecycle, from food to shopping. But so
far none of them is specifically tailored for an individual or profile. This
is where you come in. In this competition, Kagglers will develop algorithms to
identify and serve the most relevant opportunities to individuals, by
uncovering signal in customer loyalty. Your input will improve customers’
lives and help Elo reduce unwanted campaigns, to create the right experience
for customers.
