I hope it will be helpfull, as kernel of CVxTz was helpfull for me :\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/CVxTz/beating-the-baseline-keras-lb-0-38\n\nSo a big thanks to CVxTz for the very good code and to Nastika Vidwan, with their introduction of face recognition and triplet loss concepts.\nI'm just adding below an improvement of the last part of CVxTz'code.\nI suggest to replace \"Nearest Neighbor\" approach by a direct distance calculation.\nIt boost the score of about 0,04 (from 0.38 to 0.42). \nSo you don't have any excuse to attend the 5th place in the challenge ...  :-)\n\nNow i'm working on other improvements, but it's now a bit difficult because of poor number of occurences of classes\n\n... have fun :-)","outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import euclidean_distances\n\ntest_files = glob.glob(\"Whales/test/*.jpg\")\nl_image_name_test = [test_files[i].split('\\\\')[1] for i in range(len(test_files))]\nl_class_data = [data['Id'][i] for i in range(len(data))]               # data = file \"train.csv\"\n\n# test_preds = predict of inference model for test images (data = for \"train.csv\" images)\ntest_image_dist_all = euclidean_distances(test_preds, data_preds)      \npreds_str = []\n\n\nfor ind in range(len(l_image_name_test)) :\n    test_image_dist = test_image_dist_all[ind]     # distances between the test image and all the 'train.csv' images\n    vect_dist = [(l_class_data[i],test_image_dist[i]) for i in range(len(test_image_dist))]    # create list of couples (class, distance)\n    vect_dist.append((\"new_whale\", 0.0))  # add \"new_whale\" ecach time\n    vect_dist.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])    # sort  in order to have first the nearest\n    vect_dist = vect_dist[0:50]            # best 50 nearest \n    \n    vect_classes = [vect_dist[i][0] for i in range(len(vect_dist))]\n    # Maintain only one occurrence per class\n    vect_result = [vect_dist[0]] + [vect_dist[i] for i in range(1,len(vect_dist)) if vect_classes[i] not in vect_classes[0:i]]\n    vect_result = vect_result[:5]   # take fist 5 nearest\n    preds_str.append(\" \".join([x[0] for x in vect_result]))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.4","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
