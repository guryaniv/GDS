I will be using simple naive bayes along with Count Vectorization to solve this problem**\n\nSo Lets Start.\n\nLets Understand the hot terms first:\n\n**Naive Bayes Classifier**\n\n**It is a simple classifier based on bayes theorem with full independence between different features.**  I know it passed right from above the head.\n\nLets find a simple explanation:\n* So we have a dataset with [text, label] e.g.[\"This process, however, afforded me no means of...\"\t,EAP] where EAP represents the author so we have a text and we have to find out which author out of three wrote that text.\n* Now First of all computer does not understand alphabets or words, so we convert the words into numbers so make computer understand it\n* For that we simply assign a number for each unique word, e.g.  \"to be or not to be\" will be assigned numbers like to:1, be:2, or:3, not:4.\n* Now we can send input to the computer like [1,2,3,4,1,2] \n* But naive bayes does not want this it just wants the count of each words.\n* Naive bayes like the count of \"to\" or \"1\" in document1 or row1 and so on\n* So we give naive bayes input like this [0,1]:2   [0,2]:2   [0,3]:1 and so on. We are giving it the count of each word and each document so zero represents first document.\n* So we are going to have a big two dimensional matrix with lots of columns and rows equal to the number of documents given\n\nNow lets look at naive bayes again, Naive bayes considers each words as independant and does not value the position of each word: (the postion of word have no role in classifying or training in naive bayes)\n\nSecondly it is based on probability and bayes theorem, I am not going to explain it here as it will take more than necessary space so Chapter 13 of **An Introduction to information retreival by Christopher D manning , Prabhakar Raghavan\nHinrich Schütze ** Section 13.2 will explain us the naive bayes in detail\n\nhttps://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/pdf/13bayes.pdf\n\n\nNow lets come back to the dataset\n\n\nSo lets see what we got, we got a training data set with author labels and testing datasets without labels. In this we just take the training data set, Split it by using 70% for training the Naive Bayes classifier and other 30% for testing it.\nHere is the basic code and easiest one.\n\n\nSo first of all we import libraries then we load the csv file into a pandas dataframe, or in layman terms, into a python variable so that we can process it.\n\nThen we see a sample of the data using training_data.head().\n"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"baa4621c-632c-4370-913d-9e373eb2a34f","collapsed":true,"_uuid":"7e4b1390a70253b31fb5da682abcca53c02d143f","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nfrom subprocess import check_output\nprint(check_output([\"ls\", \"../input\"]).decode(\"utf8\"))\n\n#READING INPUT\ntraining_data = pd.read_csv(\"../input/train.csv\")\ntesting_data=pd.read_csv(\"../input/test.csv\")\ntraining_data.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"7a1092a3-e399-4e4e-9417-908194e50781","_uuid":"783a3f145d547a8f22486b8068f331c02b245e43"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now by just looking at the top 4 entries, it must be clear that does id have any role in determining who the author is?\nNo. Id is just used as a identifier for text NOT for author. So one thing is clear over here, that id is useless and would not help in any way to our model to learn.\n\nSo now we simple omit the id.\nSimilarly to avoid clutterness we map \"EAP\" to 0 \"HPL\" to 1 and \"MWS\" to 2 as it will be more convenient for our classifier. \nIn other words we are just telling our computer that if classifier predicts 0 for the text then it means that it is preicting \"EAP\", if 1 then it means that it is predicting \"HPL\", if 2 then it means that it is predicting 2.\n\nNext we take all the rows under the column named \"text\" and put it in X ( a variable in python)\n\nSimilarly we take all rows under the column named \"author_num\" and put it in y (a variable in python)"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"ac7c99f0-8dbb-4325-ba16-561821a40355","collapsed":true,"_uuid":"e18421f1e4cbc94ae771804ee7851ca773c94793","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"training_data['author_num'] = training_data.author.map({'EAP':0, 'HPL':1, 'MWS':2})\nX = training_data['text']\ny = training_data['author_num']\nprint (X.head())\nprint (y.head())\n\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"e9c627b9-1d2f-4ea9-a9fc-c950e6815c74","_uuid":"441cc367f1ab4a81af28b32e4f18b4bee214b5d6"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now we got the data, we got the text and the corresponing label, Now we need to split the data into training set and testing set.\nTesting set is the one which we will never show to the computer, we will take it and keep it in a safe and only use it to test the model.\n\nSo we are going to split it into 70% for training and 30% for testing."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"9159cab8-4eee-4e23-9f48-89b59e22e778","collapsed":true,"_uuid":"a48996b8f1273b24a51d1f727a132076b982eaf5","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"per=int(float(0.7)* len(X))\nX_train=X[:per]\nX_test=X[per:]\ny_train=y[:per]\ny_test=y[per:]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"7fd81da0-5dee-4e16-8f2f-4688a3a77a9c","_uuid":"cae27e89722e4ae2209b31e4f94aa851ae5b4a48"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Here are some libraries we are going to need"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"3e906dd6-0080-497e-8ab4-defe8249bc3f","collapsed":true,"_uuid":"f523dd13e0873798820f0789eb7fa6d19179923b","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer\nfrom sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"32e1ca38-e3bf-4305-a72c-be0355dc32b7","_uuid":"48425a6a44175b8cecf785c98e34139e1a56e512"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Now comes the most important part.\nVectorization**\n\nWe see that computers get crazy with text, It only understands numbers, but we have got to classify text.
