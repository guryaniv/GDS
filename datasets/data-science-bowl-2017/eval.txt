Submissions are scored on the log loss: LogLoss=− 1 n ∑ i=1 n [ y i log( y ^ i
)+(1− y i )log(1− y ^ i )], where n is the number of patients in the test set
y ^ i y is the predicted probability of the image belonging to a patient with
cancer y i y is 1 if the diagnosis is cancer, 0 otherwise log() l is the
natural (base e) logarithm Note: the actual submitted predicted probabilities
are replaced with max(min(p,1− 10 −15 ), 10 −15 ) m . A smaller log loss is
better. Submission File For each patient id in the test set, you must submit a
probability. The file should have a header and be in the following format:
