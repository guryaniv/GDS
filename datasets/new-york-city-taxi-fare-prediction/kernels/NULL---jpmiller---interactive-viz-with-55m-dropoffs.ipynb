I'm using the [PyViz](http://pyviz.org/) tools, which are designed for large scale plotting and interactivity in the web browser. I'll also use Dask as a substitute for Pandas to take advantage of multiprocessing and if needed, out-of-memory storage. \n\nThe end result of this setup is great in that you can access all 55M+ datapoints. The libraries will dynamically adjust the plot to show the right amount of detail as you zoom in and out. And you can put training data beside testing data and the views will stay synced.  It doesn't fully work once the notebook is committed but it should work in edit mode if you fork it. \n\nHere is an example of what you can see. The first picture is the bird's eye view, and the second is a zoom-in to Chelsea Piers.\n\n![BirdsEye](https://s3.amazonaws.com/nonwebstorage/NYbird.jpg) \n![Zoomed](https://s3.amazonaws.com/nonwebstorage/NYzoomed.jpg)"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"1b6212ee5c70f6421e2ccba4ff5e24e314293663"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"First some imports..."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"615748c310924faada819a431292b3b992405b09"},"cell_type":"code","source":"import dask.dataframe as dd\nimport colorcet as cc\nimport geoviews as gv\nimport holoviews as hv\nfrom holoviews.operation.datashader import datashade, dynspread\nhv.extension('bokeh')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8091bdc63f222063d35717ad3b15891cebbc0fa1"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Data Prep\nWe can load the data with Dask.
