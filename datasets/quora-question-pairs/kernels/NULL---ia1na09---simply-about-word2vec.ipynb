In turn, word embedding is one of the most popular representation of document vocabulary. Thus, we get the following hierarchy:\n\n* Document vocabulary representation -> Word embedding -> Word2Vec\n\nSo, what is word embedding? **Word embedding** is a vector representation of a word. For example, let's consider the folling three phases: \n* Agama is a reptile.\n* Snake is a reptile.\n* Reptile is a cold-blooded animal.\n\nThe **dictionary** of this corpus of text (three phrases) consists of all unique words:\n> [\"agama\", \"reptile\", \"snake\", \"a\", \"is\", \"cold-blooded\", \"animal\"]\n\nA simple vector representation of the word \"agama\" would be:\n> [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nwhere 1 stands for the word \"agama\" in our dictionary. This word embedding is called one-hot encoding. For any word, the length of a vector is always 7 in our example, because the dictionary consists of 7 unique words. This word embedding technique is very simple, but has a tremendous disadvantage. Let's take vector representations of two words: \n> \"agama\" and \"reptile\" -> [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] and [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThese two vectors provide no useful information regarding the relationships that may exist between the \"agama\" and \"reptile\". In other words, the similarity between words is not captured by the one-hot encoding. Loosely speaking, one-hot encoding does not enable the system making conclusions about the word \"agama\" given the word \"reptile\" (for example, such that agama is a cold-blooded animal).\n\n**Word2Vec is a more sophisticated word embedding technique**. This technique is based on the idea that words that occur in the same **contexts** tend to have similar meanings. I like this definition from Wikipedia \n\n> Word2Vec is a **two-layer neural network** that takes as its input a large corpus of text and produces a vector space, typically of several hundred dimensions, with each unique word in the corpus being assigned a corresponding vector in the space (Wikipedia).\n\nBelow I provide one of the best graphic representations of Word2Vec's word embedding that I found on Internet. This picture gives an intuition about how word embedding looks like in Word2Vec."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"01271c4f209df29e4016ff4b58b0f074a75e6b01"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](http://adriancolyer.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/word2vec-distributed-representation.png?w=566&zoom=2)\n\nRef: [The amazing power of word vectors](http://blog.acolyer.org/2016/04/21/the-amazing-power-of-word-vectors/)"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8aedf4c46f5d9fe634e2c97a95450e065ae73e43"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Word2Vec itself is not a deep neural network**, but it turns input text into a numerical form that deep neural networks can process as inputs."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"2344f77a4829a439379488785baa6298b093be5b"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Training of Word2Vec <a name=\"training\"></a>\n\nTo train the Word2Vec two-layer neural network, the only thing that we need to do is to change the format of Quora dataset.

It defines the number of tokens used to represent each word. For example, rake a look at the picture above. The size would be equal to 4 in this example. Each input word would be represented by 4 tokens: King, Queen, Women, Princess.  Rule-of-thumb: If a dataset is small, then size should be small too. If a dataset is large, then size should be greater too. It's the question of tuning.\n\n* **window:** The maximum distance between the target word and its neighboring word. For example, let's take the phrase \"agama is a reptile \" with 4 words (suppose that we do not exclude the stop words). If window size is 2, then the vector of word \"agama\" is directly affected by the word \"is\" and \"a\". Rule-of-thumb: a smaller window should provide terms that are more related (of course, the exclusion of stop words should be considered).\n\n* **min_count:** Ignores all words with total frequency lower than this. For example, if the word frequency is extremally low, then this word might be considered as unimportant.\n\n* **sg:** Selects training algorithm: 1 for Skip-Gram; 0 for CBOW (Continuous Bag of Words).\n\n* **workers:** The number of worker threads used to train the model.\n\nMore details about input parameters can be found [here](http://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/word2vec.html)."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"96ce87e5ea042e98cc1bbb58f8f0c87d8711da2c"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Once the vocabulary is created and the Word2Vec model is specified, I will train this model by calling \"train\" function."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"6d7629860aa0e7c9be43af0d24317e9d046fd339"},"cell_type":"code","source":"model.train(sentences=documents, total_examples=len(documents), epochs=model.iter)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"98c4846760e19d393bd7b2429c4ca3b711a921ae"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's see what happens when the function \"train\" is executed. I found a diagram (see below) that shows a Skip-Gram model architecture to produce a distributed representation of words. To understand this diagram, we should consider the size of vocablurary and the dimensionality of the word vectors (the parameter \"size\"). In our example, these are equal to 47.366 words and 150 tokens, respectively. If we take the word “immigration”, it will be one of the words in the 47.366 word vocabulary.  Therefore we can initially represent the word \"immigration\" as a 47.366 length one-hot vector.  We then link this input vector to a 150 node hidden layer.  There are totally 150 weights connecting the input layer and the hidden layer.  The activations of the nodes in this hidden layer are simply linear summations of the weighted inputs, e.g. `ohe*w1+ohe*w2+...+ohe*w150`.  These nodes are then fed into a softmax output layer.  During training, we want to change the weights of this neural network so that words surrounding “immigration” have a higher probability in the softmax output layer.  So, for instance, if our text data set has a lot of questions related to the immigration in Canada, we would want our network to assign large probabilities to words like “Canada”, \"Australia\"  (given lots of sentences containing “the immigration to Canada or Australia”)."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"6c8e4f4a9b33fb78087fd9f2bfa652b5c66dbd77"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://preview.ibb.co/iuzji0/Word2-Vec-skip-gram.jpg)"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"a1644a2fae2378a6bf4801bdca21c16ac4fde441"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We finished training our Word2Vec model.
