Nearly half of the world depends on seafood for their main source of protein.
In the Western and Central Pacific, where 60% of the worldâ€™s tuna is caught,
illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing practices are threatening marine
ecosystems, global seafood supplies and local livelihoods. The Nature
Conservancy is working with local, regional and global partners to preserve
this fishery for the future. Currently, the Conservancy is looking to the
future by using cameras to dramatically scale the monitoring of fishing
activities to fill critical science and compliance monitoring data gaps.
Although these electronic monitoring systems work well and are ready for wider
deployment, the amount of raw data produced is cumbersome and expensive to
process manually. The Conservancy is inviting the Kaggle community to develop
algorithms to automatically detect and classify species of tunas, sharks and
more that fishing boats catch, which will accelerate the video review process.
Faster review and more reliable data will enable countries to reallocate human
capital to management and enforcement activities which will have a positive
impact on conservation and our planet. Machine learning has the ability to
transform what we know about our oceans and how we manage them. You can be
part of the solution. Resources You can learn more about this competition and
