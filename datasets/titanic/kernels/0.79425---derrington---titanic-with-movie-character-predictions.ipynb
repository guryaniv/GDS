On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.\n<br>\nOne of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\n![](https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/EPf-QLPGGdbYGlKExZ3gIKLc1IU/fit-in/1024x1024/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2014/10/03/806/n/1922283/5d8c153f0f488cb0_anigif_enhanced-buzz-18158-1381217382-36/i/When-He-Tries-Keep-Things-Light-While-Freezing-Death.gif)\n<br>\nIn this challenge, we are asked to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive.

Lastly we split the training set to allow hold-out validation and cross-validation to be applied. \n<br>\nWe will also need to one hot encode and feature scale the test data.\n<br>\nFor reference:\n* Categorical data must be converted to numerical data in order to run modelling. One hot encoding first assigns a number to each different category. However, this leads to a problem e.g. consider our different Embarkation points $\\{C,Q,S\\}$. If we assign $C=0, Q=1, S=2$, then the model will believe that $S>Q>C$ which there is no evidence to support. To avoid this, we must introduce \"dummy variables\". Essentially we replace the \"Embarkation\" column by three new columns \"Embarkation_C\", \"Embarkation_Q\" and \"Embarkation_S\". We can then assign a binary response to each column and the model will proceed without misinterpreting any categorical variable as being more valuable than the others.\n* After dropping the Name variable, we now have entirely numerical data. However, since most machine learning equations are based on Euclidean distances between points $\\mathbb{R}^n$ space, we will need to perform feature scaling to avoid certain features e.g. Fare dominating the others since they are on a completely different scale. This would effectively lead to the regression being preformed only with respect to the Fare data which is highly undesirable as we want to learn from **all** the data we have. Feature scaling can be done by standardising the variables i.e. $\\frac{x-\\mu_X}{\\sigma_X}$ or by the normalisation procedure i.e. $\\frac{x-\\text{min}(X)}{\\text{max}(X)-\\text{min}(X)}$.

This meant it wasn't the right size to be fed into the classification models trained above. Consequently, I have added two additional characters, \"Jimbo\" and \"Jimbo Two\", with random values for all categories except embarked where I made sure to give one of them a \"Q\" and one of them a \"C\" so that the one hot encoded movie data would take up 10 columns and be compatible with our classifiers above.
