In data science we often have a need for creating new representations from existing data, or for transforming data from the format it is in now to the format that we want it to be in later. Maps are what handle this work, making them extremely important for getting your work done!\n\nThere are two mapping method that you will use often. [`Series.map`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.map.html) is the first, and slightly simpler one. For example, suppose that we wanted to remean the scores the wines recieved to 0.
