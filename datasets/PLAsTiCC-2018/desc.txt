Help some of the world's leading astronomers grasp the deepest properties of
the universe. The human eye has been the arbiter for the classification of
astronomical sources in the night sky for hundreds of years. But a new
facility -- the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) -- is about to
revolutionize the field, discovering 10 to 100 times more astronomical sources
that vary in the night sky than we've ever known. Some of these sources will
be completely unprecedented! The Photometric LSST Astronomical Time-Series
Classification Challenge (PLAsTiCC) asks Kagglers to help prepare to classify
the data from this new survey. Competitors will classify astronomical sources
that vary with time into different classes, scaling from a small training set
to a very large test set of the type the LSST will discover. More background
information is available here. Acknowledgements PLAsTiCC is funded through
LSST Corporation Grant Award # 2017-03 and administered by the University of
Toronto. Financial support for LSST comes from the National Science Foundation
(NSF) through Cooperative Agreement No. 1258333, the Department of Energy
(DOE) Office of Science under Contract No. DE-AC02-76SF00515, and private
funding raised by the LSST Corporation. The NSF-funded LSST Project Office for
construction was established as an operating center under management of the
Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA). The DOE-funded
effort to build the LSST camera is managed by the SLAC National Accelerator
Laboratory (SLAC). The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent
federal agency created by Congress in 1950 to promote the progress of science.
