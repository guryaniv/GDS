        "There are many factors influencing the house prices and the data shows a highly volatile period for which predictions have to be made. When inflation goes up, people see their income disappear straight into a black hole of purchases and consumption. Investing into fixed assets is a strategy to maintain more control over your income in an attempt to bridge periods of high volatility in the economy. So high inflation does not necessarily mean that people avoid purchasing houses, it can cause people to purchase more. The interest rate makes borrowing money very expensive, which reduces people's willingness to purchase more houses. Then there is also the delay over which people make decisions, you don't buy a house in one or two month's time, first you need to select a property whilst following the news how inflation and interest rates are making an impact. Then you need to worry if the contract you're about to close and the associated rates allow you to sustain a living or if the economy goes back to normal and you're stuck with an excessively high interest rate payoff that you closed off in a really bad time period. All these factors in a volatile period make it extremely difficult to predict the house price, especially given the fact that near the end of the training set we see this huge spike in the way, which has a huge impact on actions that people take and which could go either way.\n",

We are looking at an anomalous situation however and it's unclear how the house prices truly react to that. Also, it should be the goal to find great explanators or models that truly predict things well rather than training on RMSE itself, because that doesn't provide a generic model. This model would then (potentially) show a good performance when the house price goes up, but be awful when the house prices are going down or stabilizing over another period."
