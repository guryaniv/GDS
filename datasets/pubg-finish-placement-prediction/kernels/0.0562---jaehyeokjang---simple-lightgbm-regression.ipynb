Note: Self inflicted damage is subtracted.\n* **headshotKills** - Number of enemy players killed with headshots.\n* **heals** - Number of healing items used.\n* **Id** - Player’s Id\n* **killPlace** - Ranking in match of number of enemy players killed.\n* **killPoints** - Kills-based external ranking of player. (Think of this as an Elo ranking where only kills matter.) If there is a value other than -1 in rankPoints, then any 0 in killPoints should be treated as a “None”.\n* **killStreaks** - Max number of enemy players killed in a short amount of time.\n* **kills** - Number of enemy players killed.\n* **longestKill** - Longest distance between player and player killed at time of death. This may be misleading, as downing a player and driving away may lead to a large longestKill stat.\n* **matchDuration** - Duration of match in seconds.\n* **matchId** - ID to identify match. There are no matches that are in both the training and testing set.\n* **matchType** - String identifying the game mode that the data comes from. The standard modes are “solo”, “duo”, “squad”, “solo-fpp”, “duo-fpp”, and “squad-fpp”; other modes are from events or custom matches.\n* **rankPoints** - Elo-like ranking of player. This ranking is inconsistent and is being deprecated in the API’s next version, so use with caution. Value of -1 takes place of “None”.\n* **revives** - Number of times this player revived teammates.\n* **rideDistance** - Total distance traveled in vehicles measured in meters.\n* **roadKills** - Number of kills while in a vehicle.\n* **swimDistance** - Total distance traveled by swimming measured in meters.\n* **teamKills** - Number of times this player killed a teammate.\n* **vehicleDestroys** - Number of vehicles destroyed.\n* **walkDistance** - Total distance traveled on foot measured in meters.\n* **weaponsAcquired** - Number of weapons picked up.\n* **winPoints** - Win-based external ranking of player. (Think of this as an Elo ranking where only winning matters.) If there is a value other than -1 in rankPoints, then any 0 in winPoints should be treated as a “None”.\n* **groupId** - ID to identify a group within a match. If the same group of players plays in different matches, they will have a different groupId each time.\n* **numGroups** - Number of groups we have data for in the match.\n* **maxPlace** - Worst placement we have data for in the match. This may not match with numGroups, as sometimes the data skips over placements.\n* **winPlacePerc** - The target of prediction. This is a percentile winning placement, where 1 corresponds to 1st place, and 0 corresponds to last place in the match. It is calculated off of maxPlace, not numGroups, so it is possible to have missing chunks in a match."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"fa8e785465c739d4c47a2e291eabf4149be9fbfa"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Change categorical varible into dummy variable\ntrain_matchType = pd.get_dummies(train_df['matchType'])\ntest_matchType = pd.get_dummies(test_df['matchType'])\n\ntrain_df2 = train_df.drop(columns=['matchType'])\ntest_df2 = test_df.drop(columns=['matchType'])\n\ntrain_df2 = pd.concat([train_matchType, train_df2], axis = 1)\ntest_df2 = pd.concat([test_matchType, test_df2], axis = 1)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"f680d3e05e32476f58e2ad51690f92e2293fabae"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Drop outliers\ntrain_df3 = train_df2[train_df2['damageDealt'] - train_df2['damageDealt'].mean() <= (3 * train_df2['damageDealt'].std())]\ntrain_df3 = train_df2[train_df2['walkDistance'] - train_df2['walkDistance'].mean() <= (3 * train_df2['walkDistance'].std())]\ntrain_df3 = train_df2[train_df2['rideDistance'] - train_df2['rideDistance'].mean() <= (3 * train_df2['rideDistance'].std())]\ntrain_df3 = train_df2[train_df2['swimDistance'] - train_df2['swimDistance'].mean() <= (3 * train_df2['swimDistance'].std())]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"7ddae6678cca46c8a5cfb6d312baf3afb8c9c438"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Drop missing values\ntrain_df3 = train_df3.dropna()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"b88785efa6e6e254c13ede3e28dd9281992237fd"},"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.set(color_codes=True)\nsns.distplot(train_df3['winPlacePerc'])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"5211819d770f4627de02c73803ba14094d6f08f6"},"cell_type":"code","source":"_, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(20, 20))\nsns.heatmap(train_df3.iloc[:, 19:].corr(), annot=True, linewidths=.5, fmt= '.1f',ax=ax)\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"0ba22b3576321a038bd097e01a41ca29dc437589"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Splitting training dataset into train/validation set (ratio = 7:3)\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n\nid_cols = train_df3.loc[:, [\"Id\", \"groupId\", \"matchId\"]]\ntrain_df4 = train_df3.drop(columns = id_cols)\ntrain_df4.dropna(inplace=True)\n\nX = train_df4.iloc[:, 0:-1]; y = train_df4.iloc[:, -1]\nX_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=2015195017)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"bbebb8c507d28edc9d5a5f11e118e921a8e95dff","scrolled":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import lightgbm as lgb\n\nlgb_train = lgb.Dataset(X_train, label=y_train)\nlgb_val = lgb.Dataset(X_val, label=y_val)\n\nparams = {'objective': 'regression', \n          'metric': 'mae', \n          'n_estimators': 20000, \n          'early_stopping_rounds': 5,\n          'num_leaves': 31,\n          'learning_rate': 0.05,\n          'bagging_fraction': 0.7,\n          'bagging_seed': 20181219,\n          'num_threads': 5,\n          'colsample_bytree': 0.7}\n\nlgr = lgb.train(params, lgb_train, valid_sets=[lgb_train, lgb_val], early_stopping_rounds=200, verbose_eval=1000)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"3dccf331eb971199e4ce1cd3968c386460dabc65"},"cell_type":"code","source":"test_df2 = test_df2.drop(columns=['Id', 'groupId', 'matchId'])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"eb066577d46ab1ef9c507269cc7af448bad4b3f0"},"cell_type":"code","source":"y_pred_lgb = lgr.predict(test_df2, num_iteration=lgr.best_iteration)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"d753dadf29c1b0860aea7602f2952def5bcb2960"},"cell_type":"code","source":"submit_lgb = pd.DataFrame({'Id': test_df['Id'], \"winPlacePerc\": y_pred_lgb} , columns=['Id', 'winPlacePerc'])\nsubmit_lgb.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"6e0d2ff20aae9521e96927f0b2514e5733c33aa1"},"cell_type":"code","source":"submit_lgb.to_csv(\"submission_lgb.csv\", index=False)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
