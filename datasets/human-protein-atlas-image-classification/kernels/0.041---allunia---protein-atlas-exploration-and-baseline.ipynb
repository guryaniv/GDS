I have never mind that the results are useful for many kagglers that like to start with the competition but need some starter code or some inspiration. Thank you for pushing this kernel that far! :-)\n\nIf you have just found this kernel, here is a **short summary of what you can find**:\n\n1. Encoding of binary target labels out of the given multilabel list per image,\n2. Visual analysis of target protein distribution in the train set,\n3. A simple image generator that yields images of a target-protein-wishlist. Each sample that has at least one match with this list is returned.\n4. Some ideas on validation.\n5. A baseline model build with keras that is supported by:\n    * A modelparameter class that holds all parameters that are necessary to build the model, to load the data and to preprocess the images.\n    * A data generator that can be used with CPU/GPU computing to perform training and validation.\n    * An image preprocessor that rescales, reshapes and normalizes the images for feeding into the model.\n6. Ideas on how to improve the baseline model by tracking loss with a keras callback. \n7. Some ideas on how to proceed.

To make it easier for you to checkout new content, here is an **update summary** of the latest changes:\n\n* **Fix of loss visualization**: All ideas so far are now fitted once and the results of epoch and batch losses are stored as external data. This way the kernel is now able to show the visualizations that were broken each time a new fit was run. \n* By using **keras variance weight inititializer with seeds** the randomness of results is avoided and the different strategies become more comparable.  \n* Ideas how to solve jiggle-wiggle losses and gradients: dropout\n* DataGenerator: The **multithreaded version to perform predictions with DataGenerator was dropped**. I've tried out various different methods the last days (using ImageGenerator, flow_form_dataframe etc.) but every time there were some annoying problems. As training is the most expensive part, I decided to keep multithreading for fitting but to drop if for making predictions. \n* **Bug-fix** in modelparameter class. **Shuffle was always set to True**. Now default is False and you can change it interactively. \n* **Modelparameter class** has now an **attribute basepath** that points to your desired image directory. If you perform a prediction with same modelparameters, the path is overwritten during prediction with predict_path. Feels dirty, this will be changed soon. \n* The **image preprocessor is now responsible for loading the images**. With default model parameter n_channels=1 it only returns the green image. If you like to change that increase n_channels as you like or do it by hand but make sure than modelparameters has a suitable n_channels. \n* The **f1 score** of the improved metric is extended by **min, max, std** besides the mean to gain more insights of the f1 score distribution between different target classes. \n* Some ideas what causes the gradient noise and how to set up solutions.

This need not be very complex or very good. Its our first attempt to play with and to figure out how to improve. For this purpose let's use the deep learning library [keras](https://keras.io/). This tools makes it easy for us to build and train neural networks. First of all, we should collect some ideas:\n\n* To **stay simple let's use only the green channel image of our images per id**. The competition says that it shows the stained target proteins and consequently it's hopefully the most informative one. The other images are like references showing microtubules, nucleus and endoplasmatic reticulum. We don't acutally now how informative they are and in our current state they would blow up our neural network with a huge amount of network weigths that we might not need.\n* Let's use **generators to only load data images of our batch and not all in once**. Using keras fit_generator, evaluate_generator and predict_generator we can directly connect them to keras without worrying much about how keras does its job. For this purpose I highly follow a descprition of a post in the www for which you will find the link below.\n* It could be advantegous to write a **small class that does simple preprocessing per image.** This way we can easily change something of this phase without producing chaos in the model itself or during data loading.   \n* I'm going to use a **small class that hold parameters that are used or shared between the data loader, the image preprocessor and the baseline model**. Passing an instance of this class to them reduced the risk of setting different parameters and obtaining mismatch errors for example during build & compile of the network layers. \n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"5cd298c9360c772a9c8b7946425449db8be0ab8f"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Shared Parameter class"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"96df4f1aa1085b95b806b48071c0737d45a5b708","_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"class ModelParameter:\n    \n    def __init__(self, basepath,\n                 num_classes=28,\n                 image_rows=512,\n                 image_cols=512,\n                 batch_size=200,\n                 n_channels=1,\n                 row_scale_factor=4,\n                 col_scale_factor=4,\n                 shuffle=False,\n                 n_epochs=1):\n        self.basepath = basepath\n        self.num_classes = num_classes\n        self.image_rows = image_rows\n        self.image_cols = image_cols\n        self.batch_size = batch_size\n        self.n_channels = n_channels\n        self.shuffle = shuffle\n        self.row_scale_factor = row_scale_factor\n        self.col_scale_factor = col_scale_factor\n        self.scaled_row_dim = np.int(self.image_rows / self.row_scale_factor)\n        self.scaled_col_dim = np.int(self.image_cols / self.col_scale_factor)\n        self.n_epochs = n_epochs","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"bc20cc4fdebf53b66bda3899974bd8758159d85f"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Ok, now we will create an instance of this class and pass it to the DataGenerator, the BaseLineModel and the ImagePreprocessor."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"96b80b33c817ad07deac345e36c46c062255c60d"},"cell_type":"code","source":"parameter = ModelParameter(train_path)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"4497282fcdc0d68554e3878bb82bae8942eda681"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Image Preprocessor\n\nLet's write a simple image preprocessor that handles for example the rescaling of the images.

Let's take a closer look to the competition scoring and alternatives:\n\n* **F1 macro score**: Check out this [nice implementation of Guglielmo Camporese](https://www.kaggle.com/guglielmocamporese/macro-f1-score-keras). Thank you very much! We can easily add it to our model.\n* But even with that score we should be careful! We have 28 different classes that are **very different in their frequency of being present**.  In addition we have to deal with **highly imbalanced classes per single target**. Even for the most common target nucleoplasm there are only 40 % of samples that show it and 60 % not. This imbalance becomes even more dramatic for seldom targets like rods and rings. We should **attach more importance to true positives**. \n* Well, there is **one problem with the competition score** that we can use to measure the performance of our model: **The f1 mean**. The mean is not robust towards outliers and consequently not very informative to understand the distribution of f1 scores for each target class. Perhaps we will make nice predictions for Cytosol but bad ones for Nucleoplasmn... who knows? Consequently it could be nice to introduce some further statistical quantities like **min** as well as **max** and the **standard deviation** .

After one epoch?** \n\nIf we take a look at simple feedforward networks that are close related to CNNs add gradient descent, we can see that learning means to compute the derivatives of the loss with respect to the weights over all samples:\n\n$$ w_{i,j}^{new} = w_{i,j}^{old} - \\eta \\cdot \\partial_{w_{i,j}} E$$\n\nWith a set of independent observation samples, we can obtain the gradients this way:\n\n$$ \\partial_{w_{i,j}} E = \\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\partial_{w_{i,j}} E_{n}$$"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"6f0edac71f3ad51f238324ff2c573a6b6af792ad"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We are computing the change of the loss with respect to a change in the weights for each sample one after another. Consequently in original gradient descent we need to pass the whole dataset once for just one single update step of gradient descent. As our initial weights are not sufficent to solve the classification task we need many such update steps. **But what if the dataset it too large to wait a long time just for one of these steps?**\n\nPerhaps it would be sufficient and already good to use only some $M < N$ of the $N$ samples to compute the gradients $\\partial_{w_{i,j}} E$:\n\n$$ \\partial_{w_{i,j}} E = \\sum_{m=1}^{M} \\partial_{w_{i,j}} E_{m} $$\n\nThis way **we could use only a batch of samples, compute the gradients and perform the update of weights**. After that we continue by computing the gradients with the next batch. This could be done in sequence of samples or random with replacement. This means that we already start learning without passing the whole dataset. In my case I chose a batch_size of 200. With a total number of samples of around 20000 in my training set this means that I have already done 200 weight updates. **After doing so I have used each sample once and this means the whole dataset was passed through gradient descent**. As far as I know this means, **one epoch**. In addition we can now say that we want to shuffle the samples before doing weight updates after each batch again in the next epoch. This way our model sees a different set, computes some other gradients and hence the loss minimziation could be more robust.

Computing the gradient with batches is a stochastic process: Depending on the batch samples the gradients may sometimes lead to some good update directions in weight space that points to some minimum of loss.... and sometimes they could lead to the opposite. Well this really depends on the samples within one batch. This becomes more robust with **more samples per batch.** But then we will **need even more epochs** as we make less weight updata aka learning steps! But even if this stochastic gradient descent looks wiggly it has an advantage too: It can escape from local minima of the loss function. That's nice. \n\nBefore we improve the model using more epochs and smaller batches, let's **implement a new feature: a loss callback**.

In addition we have to be very **careful with small batches as its target distribution might not reflect the overall pattern**. Imagine we would try to distinguish dogs from cats. With a batch size of 10 we are likely to fill up these places with imbalanced targets. For example it could be occupied with cats only. This would yield gradients that try to improve the detection of cats thereby changing the weights we might need to identify dogs.

And this can be done to the detriment of the dogs as both classes share weights. Hence changing the weights with batches of imbalanced classes can lead to jiggles. \n\nNow let's consider a dropout-layer: It randomly selects a given percentage of input neurons and drops them during the current training step. Taking a look at [this paper](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume15/srivastava14a/srivastava14a.pdf) (linked at keras documentation) you can see that the forward and backward propagation is done only with this reduced, thinned kind of network. In our case this means that each learning step some weights will be untouched and not used to compute gradients. This is great as this would mean that some weight that could be good for predicting dogs will not change after we process a batch with cats only. ;-)\n\nConsequently if you have a **problem with overfitting** (learning too much out of your training data and loosing generalization performance) **or you have very small, imbalanced batches you should consider dropout** as a strategy. But before turning happy and starting to use dropout frequently, we should think about its downside: Dropping neruons during training and learning with a thinned kind of networks means that **we freeze learning each step a bit**. And the randomness of frosty the dropout snowman can turn to a problem difficult to graps: Which neurons should be dropped, are there some for which dropping is good and some for which it is bad? After which layer in our network does it make sense to use it?Perhaps it would have been better to use some neurons that were dropped a random dropout session during one batch learning step... we don't know. Perhaps we have prevented the success of a learning step given one batch and improved learning given another batch. The information flow through the network is somehow a blackbox for us and this randomness of thinned network learning makes it more difficult to understand what's going on. \n\nYou can see that in my baseline model I'm already using dropout. This choice was somehow arbitrarily as I used an example network that can be found to classify mnist digits as a starting point. Hence let's improve again and **turn dropout to a plug-and-play feature**:\n\n```\nclass ImprovedModel(BaseLineModel):\n    \n    def __init__(self, modelparameter,\n                 my_metrics=[f1_mean, f1_std, f1_min, f1_max],\n                 use_dropout=True):\n        \n        super().__init__(modelparameter)\n        self.my_metrics = my_metrics\n        self.use_dropout = use_dropout\n\n    def build_model(self):\n        self.model = Sequential()\n        self.model.add(Conv2D(16, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=self.input_shape))\n        self.model.add(Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu'))\n        self.model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))\n        if self.use_dropout:\n            self.model.add(Dropout(0.25))\n        self.model.add(Flatten())\n        self.model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu'))\n        if self.use_dropout:\n        self.model.add(Dropout(0.5))\n        self.model.add(Dense(self.num_classes, activation='sigmoid'))\n```"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"a0fb6a83c1a1cc6730f9b852ae656cda111d09d7"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Our last losses were obtained by using dropout with high percentage (25 % and 50 %) of dropped neurons. **What will happen if we do not use our dropout layers?**\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"099f2156b82eab629f301f8cf82a9d8874e4b465"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Run computation and store results as csv\nif kernelsettings.fit_improved_without_dropout == True:\n    model = ImprovedModel(parameter, use_dropout=False)\n    model.build_model()\n    model.compile_model()\n    model.set_generators(training_generator, validation_generator)\n    epoch_history = model.learn()\n    proba_predictions = model.predict(predict_generator)\n    #model.save(\"improved_model.h5\")\n    improved_proba_predictions = pd.DataFrame(proba_predictions, columns=wishlist)\n    improved_proba_predictions.to_csv(\"improved_nodropout_predictions.csv\")\n    improved_losses = pd.DataFrame(epoch_history.history[\"loss\"], columns=[\"train_loss\"])\n    improved_losses[\"val_loss\"] = epoch_history.history[\"val_loss\"]\n    improved_losses.to_csv(\"improved_nodropout_losses.csv\")\n    improved_batch_losses = pd.DataFrame(model.history.losses, columns=[\"batch_losses\"])\n    improved_batch_losses.to_csv(\"improved_nodropout_batch_losses.csv\")\n# If you already have done a baseline fit once, \n# you can load predictions as csv and further fitting is not neccessary:\nelse:\n    improved_proba_predictions_no_dropout = pd.read_csv(\n        \"../input/protein-atlas-eab-predictions/improved_nodropout_predictions.csv\", index_col=0)\n    improved_losses_no_dropout= pd.read_csv(\n        \"../input/protein-atlas-eab-predictions/improved_nodropout_losses.csv\", index_col=0)\n    improved_batch_losses_no_dropout = pd.read_csv(\n        \"../input/protein-atlas-eab-predictions/improved_nodropout_batch_losses.csv\", index_col=0)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"51e482ffa9ff1ef8867992a10dceb238bc0c2fc3"},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig, ax = plt.subplots(2,1,figsize=(20,13))\nax[0].plot(np.arange(1,11), improved_losses[\"train_loss\"].values, 'r--o', label=\"train_loss_dropout\")\nax[0].plot(np.arange(1,11), improved_losses_no_dropout[\"train_loss\"].values, 'r-o', label=\"train_loss_no_dropout\")\nax[0].plot(np.arange(1,11), improved_losses[\"val_loss\"].values, 'g--o', label=\"validation_loss\")\nax[0].plot(np.arange(1,11), improved_losses_no_dropout[\"val_loss\"].values, 'g-o', label=\"validation_loss_no_dropout\")\nax[0].set_xlabel(\"Epoch\")\nax[0].set_ylabel(\"Loss\")\nax[0].set_title(\"Loss evolution per epoch\")\nax[0].legend()\nax[1].plot(improved_batch_losses.batch_losses.values[-800::], 'r-+', label=\"train_batch_losses_dropout\")\nax[1].plot(improved_batch_losses_no_dropout.batch_losses.values[-800::], 'b-+',\n           label=\"train_batch_losses_no_dropout\")\nax[1].set_xlabel(\"Number of update steps in total\")\nax[1].set_ylabel(\"Train loss\")\nax[1].set_title(\"Train loss evolution per batch\");\nax[1].legend();","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"9a0fbfd1d2ab88ea2be51687311a5da8b6be7bc1"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Where to go next?\n\n* optimization objective alias loss choice\n* hyperparameter search"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
