The main things hyperparameters that I had to tune were `min_word_count` and `context_size`. \n\nI usually train word2vec models with a `min_word_count` closer to 3-5, but since this dataset is so large I had to bump it up to 10. When I was training the model on a smaller `min_word_count` I was getting a lot of winery and vinyard noise in my word similarities (ie the words most similar to \"cherry\" were a bunch of foreign vinyards, wineries, regions, etc.). After looking through some of the descriptions I came to the conclusion that most of the wine descriptions don't mention the wine varietal, vinyard, or winery, but some do. So I played with the `min_word_count` until those rare instances had less of an effect on the model.\n\nI also had to play with the `context_size` quite a bit. 10 is a pretty large context size, but it makes sense here because really all of the words in a sentence are related to each other in the context of wine descriptions and what were are trying to accomplish. I might even experiment with bumping the `context_size` up higher at some point, but even now most of the words in each sentence will be associated with each other in the model."}, {"cell_type": "code", "metadata": {"trusted": false, "collapsed": true, "_execution_state": "idle", "_cell_guid": "059637c1-5545-4dd2-a189-46f6e5831d03", "_uuid": "dba87b927f53650a554605bbe12249190225f6fe"}, "outputs": [], "execution_count": null, "source": "num_features = 300\nmin_word_count = 10\nnum_workers = multiprocessing.cpu_count()\ncontext_size = 10\ndownsampling = 1e-3\nseed=1993"}, {"cell_type": "code", "metadata": {"trusted": false, "_execution_state": "idle", "_cell_guid": "ad126024-f453-44e9-9f58-255f205a2ff1", "_uuid": "2c8ea0bff4dbabfa45be59a0c90c5bb0dc13ae9b"}, "outputs": [], "execution_count": null, "source": "wine2vec = w2v.Word2Vec(\n    sg=1,\n    seed=seed,\n    workers=num_workers,\n    size=num_features,\n    min_count=min_word_count,\n    window=context_size,\n    sample=downsampling\n)"}, {"cell_type": "code", "metadata": {"trusted": false, "collapsed": true, "_execution_state": "idle", "_cell_guid": "b9e22254-198c-408c-81c4-0fd043b855e4", "_uuid": "8322de71ed698e75c6454b33057b3879cec984d2"}, "outputs": [], "execution_count": null, "source": "wine2vec.build_vocab(sentences)"}, {"cell_type": "code", "metadata": {"trusted": false, "_execution_state": "idle", "_cell_guid": "56ee7ca3-4336-4bbf-8531-e4e432de5d09", "_uuid": "6334bafab557f85ebde1b577bf02861f6c84b976"}, "outputs": [], "execution_count": null, "source": "print('Word2Vec vocabulary length:', len(wine2vec.wv.vocab))"}, {"cell_type": "code", "metadata": {"trusted": false, "_execution_state": "idle", "_cell_guid": "d9b68edd-0978-4108-a7c6-fa41102aec47", "_uuid": "a1337085444266198c12d2fab36d2f0fdc358926"}, "outputs": [], "execution_count": null, "source": "print(wine2vec.corpus_count)"}, {"cell_type": "code", "metadata": {"trusted": false, "_execution_state": "idle", "_cell_guid": "6d28afc1-3514-41f1-9658-3dd0f171ce01", "_uuid": "0262bf97ee18cfedd668e9fd7a516e15b3575e0e"}, "outputs": [], "execution_count": null, "source": "wine2vec.train(sentences, total_examples=wine2vec.corpus_count, epochs=wine2vec.iter)"}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {"_cell_guid": "a3ab443c-308a-43c8-b912-ac5c20a3d4f1", "_uuid": "aefc927e56d5d6f5b9d68cb9f3d499c375c7daf8"}, "outputs": [], "execution_count": null, "source": "### Playing with the Model\nNow that we have a trained model we can get to the fun part and start playing around with the results.
