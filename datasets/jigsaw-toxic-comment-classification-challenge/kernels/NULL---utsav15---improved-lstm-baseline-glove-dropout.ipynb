It is indeed. a proud moment Not just for Kerala but also for entire nation . Bharat petroleum kochin refinary has played a critical role in popularizing the clean fuel LPG Among Masses in Kerala and neighboring states for more than 50 years. I recall my childhood. when I had seen Many mother struggling with the firewood stove in the kitchen ever since i've always though of  improving their situation and providing healthy kitchen to mother and sisters of India. Ujwalla scheme of government of india is a way to realize the dream i'm happy that since may 2016 nearly six crores LPG connections have been provided to the poorest of the poor in the country. friends More than 23 crores LPG consumers has joined the pehel scheme , pehel has helped in identifying ghost accounts, multiple accounts and inactive accounts. pehel has entered  into the Guinness Book of World Records at the largest direct benefit transfer scheme in the world. over one crore customer have given up LPG subsidy under giveitup initiative. by doubling the LPG production with the help of recent expansion kochi refinary is making great contribution to ujjwala. to over come environment pollution, The government of India is promoting the use of Land Management friendly transport. That is CNG by expanding the coverage of city gas Distribution Network in the country. After the successful completion of 10 cjd bidding round, More than 400 distance of country. will be connected for providing pipe gas supply. the national greed or pradhan mantri urja ganga  Has also been created to have gas basic economy and enhance the share of gas in the energy basket. The government has thought of developing additional 50000 km of gas pipeline network to cut down on import of crude oil. Government has taken decisive steps towards reducing import by 10% and saving precious foreign exchange, establishing 12 2-g ethanol plants. The Indian refined industry at done well in establishing as a major player globally. India which is the second largest oil refinery in Asia is emerging as  Refinery hub with refining more than its demand the country  capacity is currently more 247 mmtpa. I think this opportunity. to congratulate all part of the timely completion of IREP. Last but not least. I recognize. the work of all those labourers who work day and night during construction. I'm told that at the peak of the project over 20k workers working at the site here are the real heroes of project. integrated Refinery Expansion Project was Also  strategic move of bharat petroleum to diversify into non fuel sector . petrochemicals are a grade of chemicals which we not speak much about But they exist invisibly and touch many aspects of a daily life this includes building materials plastic and paints , clothings, Clothing and other fabrics, automatic parts cosmetic and medicines. most of these chemicals are imported from other countries It is our Endeavour to see that these petrochemicals are manufactured in India itself. I'm happy that using the capability of refinary to produce propylene after execution of IRIP. BPCL had gone ahead with putting up 3 world scale plant to manufacture acrylic and also ethanol under make in India. petrochemicals are used in paint coating. bpcl is starting the construction of a petrochemical complex where it would produce polyoil that find use in cosmetic and Medicine. I'm sure by all these many  industry would come to Kochi. I hope the petrochemical park plan by state government would become operational soon and Liberate the business opportunities provided by the petrochemical Ventur of Bpcl. I'm happy to know that bpcl along with other PSU and developing employee youth. I'm delighted to lay the foundation stone of the second Campus of the institute at atmanor near the Holy Temple I'm also glad to know that Indian Oil Corporation storage facility around 10 km from here at cost of 50 crores. This will enhance LPG storage capacity and also reduce road moevement of lpg tankers, last August when Kerala was passing through the worst flood in a hundred years. bpcl Kochi refinary was running Against All Odds I understand. Then many employees stayed in the refinary to ensure continuous production. bpcl Kochi business binder to keep up the spirit of Harbour social commitment and Innovation about its next stage of development. We are proud of cochina refinary contribution to our nation building. But now we have an explanation, I wish that kochi refinary leads petrochemical revolution in Southern India and support the growing needs of a new India. Thank you. Thank you very much.A great retail with breaking ties and listen, ladies and gentlemen, we come to the end of the formal functions on behalf of all of this present a heartfelt gratitude for attending dysfunction and making a truly memorable with your graceful presents and eloquent speech a big.
