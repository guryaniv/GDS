Zillow has been able to improve the median margin of error from 14% at the Zestimate's release to 5% as of 2017. However, they have introduced a competition to Data Scientists to further improve the accuracy of the Zestimate. The goal of this project is to produce a model that  accurately predicts the logerror produced by the Zestimate algorithm's attempt to predict the price of a house. Success is measured by minimizing the mean absolute error between our prediction and the Zestimate log-error. The log-error is defined as:\n  \n           logerror = log(Zestimate) - log(SalePrice)\n           \n           MAE = SIGMA |predicted logerror - logerror| / n\n\nWe have been provided data on a variety of different features of Los Angeles-area homes sold in the year 2016. Some of these features are numerical and some are categorical.

Our discussion of the variables below creates some hypotheses for what we expect a machine learning model to uncover.\n\nIt is tough to ignore the very white lines that segment this heatmap. They are the result of sparse data and are not perfectly correlated variables. For example, there is no logical reason that *assessmentyear* and *decktypeid* ought to be correlated. Instead, these are variables with low mass.\n\nLighter squares on this heat map indicate that the variables are correlated. There are five squares that stick out. The first is between *calculatedfinishedsquarefeet* and *finishedsquarefeet12*. Both of these variables actually capture the same features of a home - the finished living area. \n\nOther lighter squares are *structuretaxvaluedollarcnt*, which measures the value of the structures on the property, *taxvaluedollarcnt*, which measures the value of the property, *landtaxvaluedollarcnt*, which measures the value of the land on the property, and *taxamount*, which is the total tax assessed. It is unsurprising that these variables are highly related to each other. Regardless of their similarity, Zillow decided to include *all of them* in the data provided to contestants. There are a couple of reasons why these variables might prove to be useful. First, the completeness of data collection for each variable might differ, so there might be value in the presence of the variable. And second, they measure slightly different things and variation across different tax areas in L.A. might be meaningful for the purchase of a home.\n\nThere are some surprisingly strong connections between variables one might not have thought would display such strong correlations. For example,  the *regioncountyid* and *airconditioningtypeid* display a very strong negative correlation. One could imagine that newer houses might be equipped with central air conditioning while older houses may have window units. However, the connection to region county seems tenuous unless there is some regulation or code in place that requires certain types of air condition vs. others.\n\nAnother interesting strongly negative correlation arises between the *propertylandusetypeid* variable and *garagetotalsqft*. We wouldn't expect an apartment to have a very large garage (or maybe we should depending on how this variable is measured) while a mansion in Bel Air could have a garage the size of some other homes. Lack of transparency on variable measurement degrades trust in the modeling exercise.\n\nFinally, we can visualize how a sample of these variables are correlated with *logerror* through pair plots. We are choosing to visualize features that are present for more than 90% of observations and are not some sort of numeric identifier. For example, although most properties contain *censustractandblock*, we are not including it in this visualization because it is census ID. This 90% cutoff is being used for this visualization but will not necessarily be adhered to for our model-building.\n\nWhat we care most about in this display are the bivariate plots with logerror.  Remember from the above graph of the logerror that there is a strong presence of outliers. We can use the below graph to see if the logerror outliers are associated with any variables in particular. There are several bivariate plots that have a reverse funnel shape, meaning that the outliers for logerror are located at the bottom and that prediction for the houses with features higher up the y - axis (if you look in the first column). Logerror's relationships with *roomcnt* is particularly interesting, because it seems to suggest that Zillow's algorithm does not make accurate predictions for housing with lower *roomcnt*, and there is a decent spread as the *roomcnt* grows until the accuracy increases rather drastically. In many other cases, the larger the house or the more amount of tax dollars associated with the house, the more accurate prediction. Perhaps there are some mediating variables that make the prediction better for these houses, such as recency of the previous purchase or perhaps recent construction.

Again, we see that the size of the house and the tax amounts are the most important variables, but not the next set of variables are very different. When the house was built and where it was built end up being very influential. This is logical, because older houses tend to need more work done in order to make them livable. The end result being that the price of the house will decrease with the amount of expected work that is needed for updates. And second, locaition, and specifically lat and lon are a very precise way to determine where some house is on the map.
