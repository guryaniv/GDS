They use the shape of whales’ tails and unique markings found in footage to identify what species of whale they’re analyzing and meticulously log whale pod dynamics and movements. For the past 40 years, most of this work has been done manually by individual scientists, leaving a huge trove of data untapped and underutilized.\n\nIn this competition, we’re challenged to build an algorithm to identify individual whales in images. we’ll analyze Happywhale’s database of over 25,000 images, gathered from research institutions and public contributors. By contributing, we’ll help to open rich fields of understanding for marine mammal population dynamics around the globe."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"4d7de0db945f943c58b3000b19ce4d62be697356"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **Available Data**\n\nThis training data contains thousands of images of humpback whale flukes.

Convolution preserves the relationship between pixels by learning image features using small squares of input data. It is a mathematical operation that takes two inputs such as image matrix and a filter or kernal\n\nMax pooling is a type of operation that is typically added to CNNs following individual convolutional layers. When added to a model, max pooling reduces the dimensionality of images by reducing the number of pixels in the output from the previous convolutional layer.\n\nDropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training. They are “dropped-out” randomly. This means that their contribution to the activation of downstream neurons is temporally removed on the forward pass and any weight updates are not applied to the neuron on the backward pass. As a neural network learns, neuron weights settle into their context within the network. Weights of neurons are tuned for specific features providing some specialization. Neighboring neurons become to rely on this specialization, which if taken too far can result in a fragile model too specialized to the training data. This reliant on context for a neuron during training is referred to complex co-adaptations. You can imagine that if neurons are randomly dropped out of the network during training, that other neurons will have to step in and handle the representation required to make predictions for the missing neurons. This is believed to result in multiple independent internal representations being learned by the network. The effect is that the network becomes less sensitive to the specific weights of neurons. This in turn results in a network that is capable of better generalization and is less likely to overfit the training data.\n\nFlatten() flattens the output and feed into a fully connected layer (FC Layer)"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"a81a701629b672c87f9e2a78e71793ea3c55a155"},"cell_type":"code","source":"classifier.add(Convolution2D(64, 5, 5, activation = 'relu'))\nclassifier.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size = (2, 2)))\nclassifier.add(Dropout(0.25))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"6024cd4967ee2450f3100a6c8747a4b9b2c47403"},"cell_type":"code","source":"classifier.add(Convolution2D(32, 3, 3, activation = 'relu'))\nclassifier.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size = (2, 2)))\nclassifier.add(Dropout(0.25))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"9adf27ed0624d675fd9592961e7a0d26ba8cd063"},"cell_type":"code","source":"classifier.add(Convolution2D(16, 3, 3, activation = 'relu'))\nclassifier.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size = (2, 2)))\nclassifier.add(Dropout(0.3))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"b104b6a6fc16a94a085a3e32adfdef351444a0ce"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Step 3 - Flattening"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"51cbff380a91196295460dfa4cdaba2ded0caa07"},"cell_type":"code","source":"classifier.add(Flatten())","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"1481b242f733af63e914df8a993e862518aabd2d"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Step 4 - Full connection"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"ee7889a1d2375e8d3b26c6ab6c86cead4e8dec68"},"cell_type":"code","source":"classifier.add(Dense(output_dim = 240, activation = 'relu'))\nclassifier.add(BatchNormalization())\nclassifier.add(Dense(output_dim = y_train.shape[1], activation = 'sigmoid'))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"fa4b75a3bcdb1e055d43adc0045a1517fe065bcd"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Optimizer And Annealer"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"6955df55d74cf62d0d29a0f5fe413f8f6cbfc5a8"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The Adam optimization algorithm is an extension to stochastic gradient descent that has recently seen broader adoption for deep learning applications in computer vision and natural language processing.\n\nStochastic gradient descent maintains a single learning rate (termed alpha) for all weight updates and the learning rate does not change during training.\n\n**Adaptive Gradient Algorithm** (AdaGrad) that maintains a per-parameter learning rate that improves performance on problems with sparse gradients (e.g. natural language and computer vision problems).\n\n**Root Mean Square Propagation** (RMSProp) that also maintains per-parameter learning rates that are adapted based on the average of recent magnitudes of the gradients for the weight (e.g. how quickly it is changing).
