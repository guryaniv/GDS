So, knowing how to interpret, analyze, and manipulate data is fundemental to being scientifically literate. In this notebook, let's take a look at a dataset courtesy of Kaggle.com. The data is from wine reviews scaped from WineEnthusiast.com. It is multidemensional (see above) including the price, country of origin, grape variety, and point rating awarded to each wine. Below we will take a preliminary look at this dataset. We will consider how the different dimensions of the dataset are similar and different and will visualize the data in a number of different ways. After this notebook you will know:\n", "* the difference between nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio data.\n", "* how a histogram and box (and whisker) plot can communicate information about the distribution of data. \n", "* properties of a normal (Gaussian) distribution \n", "\n", "This notebook uses Python, which is a powerful programming language prfered by many data scientists.

For example, some of the data are character strings representing grape names or country names, others are numerical such as price. Moreover, the data can be classified based on the type of scale it is based on. For example, the price data is based on a scale that starts at zero (\\$0.00) and has a well-defined interval between values on this scale. In other words, the interval between \\$1.00 and \\$2.00 is the same as the interval between \\$5.00 and \\$6.00. Such data (called ratio data) iis very nice to work with for a variety of reasons but other types of data scales exist. Here is a summary of four different types of data including examples of each from the WineEnthusiasts data. \n", "* **Nominal** data are categorical labels, symbols, or names without numerical significance or natural order. However, nominal data can be tabulated into frequency tables. Later we will learn a test called the chi-squared test that is useful for interpreting nominal data sets. The countries, variety, and winery dimensions of the WineEnthusiast data are examples of nominal data.\n", "* **Ordinal** data are numbers, labels, or symbols that have a definite order or hierarchy but there is no gaurentee that the intervals between adjacent labels is uniform. For example, a list of the finishing order of runners in a marathon would be an example of ordinal data. The points dimension of the WineEnthusiast data is probably ordinal because these values are assigned by subjective wine tasters. However, below we will treat it as interval data.\n", "* **Interval** data are numbers with a definite order and a well defined and constant interval between values. However, there is no absolute zero on the scale. The year of the vintage (which could be scraped from the title dimension) is an example of interval data.\n", "* **Ration** data (see above) are numbers with a both constant interval and a scale with an absolute zero.

The most important distribution in statistics and probably all of science is a distribution that looks very much like this called the normal or Gaussian distribution. Strickly speaking, the distribution of wine point scores is can not be Gaussian because it is bounded on both sides (minimum of 80 and maximum of 100) and ther scores themselves are probably not really interval data.

In many situations, the assumpiton is that the underlying distribiton is a normal distribution.

The three histograms below show the distribution of sample means from the price data for three different sample sizes, 10, 100, and 1000. In addition to the distribution getting more normal as the sample size increases, notice that the range of likely average prices is also getting narrower.
