Five different types of wine is a good number because it keeps the result interpretable; eight is sometimes mentioned as a suggested upper bound. Many dataset fields will not fit this critereon naturally, so you will have to \"make do\", as here, by selecting a group of interest.\n\nThe second limitation is one of interpretability.
