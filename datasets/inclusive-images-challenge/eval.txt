For this competition each image has multiple ground truth labels. We will use
Mean F2 score to measure the algorithm quality. The metric is also known as
the example based F-score with a beta of 2. The F2 metric weights recall more
heavily than precision, but a good recognition algorithm will still balance
precision and recall. Moderately good performance on both will be favored over
extremely good performance on one and poor performance on the other.
Submission File For every image in the dataset, submission files should
contain two columns: image id and predicted labels. Labels should be a space-
delimited list. Note that if the algorithm doesnâ€™t predict anything, the
column can be left blank. The file must have a header and should look like the
following: image_id,labels 2b2b327132556c767a736b3d,/m/0sgh53y /m/0g4cd0
