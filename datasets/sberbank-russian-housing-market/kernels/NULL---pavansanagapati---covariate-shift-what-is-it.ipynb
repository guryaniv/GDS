Why do you think this is the case?\n\nOne of the differences lies in the quality of data that has been provided. In Data Science Competitions, the datasets are carefully curated. Usually, a single large dataset is split into train and test file. So, most of the times the train and test have been generated from the same distribution.\n\nBut this is not the case when dealing with real world problems, especially when the data has been collected over a long period of time. In such cases, there may be multiple variables / environment changes might have happened during that period. If proper care is not taken then, the training dataset cannot be used to predict anything about the test dataset in a usable manner.\n\nIn this kernel, we will see the different types of problems or Dataset Shift that we might encounter in the real world. Specifically, we will be talking in detail about one particular kind of shift in the Dataset (**Covariate shift**), the existing methods to deal with this kind of shift and an in depth demonstration of a particular method to correct this shift.\n\n## Table of Contents\n   - <a href='#1'>1.

What is Dataset Shift?</a>\n\nEvery time you participate in a competition, your journey will look quite similar to the one shown in the figure below.\n <img src=\"http://i67.tinypic.com/11uyd5g.png\">\nLet me explain this with the help of a scenario depicted in the picture below. You are given a train and a test file in a competition. You complete the preprocessing, the feature engineering and the cross validation part on the model created but you do not get the same result as the one you get on the cross-validation. No matter what validation strategy you try, it seems like you are bound to get different results in comparison to the cross validation.\n <img src=\"http://i63.tinypic.com/a26ed2.png\">\n\nWhat can be a possible reason for this failure? So, if you carefully notice the first picture, you will find that you did all the manipulation by just looking at the train file. Therefore, you completely ignored the information contained in the test file.\n\nNow take a look back on the second picture, you will notice that the training file contains information about male and females of fairly younger age while the test file contains information about people of older age. Therefore it means that the distribution of data contained in the train and test file is significantly different.\n\nSo, if you build your model based on the data set containing information about people having lower age and predict on a data set containing higher values of age, that will definitely give you a low score. The reason is that there will a wide gap in the interest and the activities between these two groups. So your model will fail in these conditions.\n\nThis change in the distribution of data contained in train and test file is called dataset shift (or drifting).\n "},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"2b076be8b82316a7017aa089fab8181a83346fd4"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## <a id='2'>2. What causes Dataset Shift?</a>\n\nTry to think some of the examples, where you can encounter the problem of dataset shift.\n\nBasically, in the real world, dataset shift mainly occurs because of the change of environments (popularly called as non-stationary environment), where the environment can be referred as location, time, etc.\n\nLet us consider an example. We collected the sales of various item during the period of July-September. Now your job is to predict the sales during the period of Diwali. The visual representation of sales in the train (blue line) and test (black line) file would be similar to the image shown below.\n \n <img src=\"http://i63.tinypic.com/8zo7sj.png\">\n \n Clearly, the sales during the time of Diwali would be much higher as compared to routine days. Therefore we can say that it is the situation of dataset shift, which occurred due to change of time period between our train and test file.\n\nBut our machine learning algorithms work by ignoring these changes. They presume that the train and test environments match and even if they don’t, it assumes that it makes no difference if the environment changes.\n\nNow take a look back at both of the examples that we discussed above. Is there any difference between them?\n\nYes, in the first scenario, there was a shift in the age (independent variable or predictor) of the population due to which we were getting wrong predictions. While in the latter one, there was a shift in the sales (target variable) of the items. This brings the next topic to the table – Different types of Dataset shifts.\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"2eed3581ea7728f48db5d02ac4bec0488c9f1c2b"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## <a id='3'>3. Types of Dataset Shift</a>\nDataset shift could be divided into three types:\n\n- Shift in the independent variables (**Covariate Shift**)\n- Shift in the target variable (**Prior probability shift**)\n- Shift in the relationship between the independent and the target variable (**Concept Shift**)\n\nIn this kernel, we will discuss only covariate shift in this article since the other two topics are still an active research area and there has not been any substantial work to mitigate these problems.\n\nWe will also see the methods to identify Covariate shift and the proper measures that can be taken in order to improve the predictions."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"0195b7c292e5e7284b9edc4340e8ba20899e81c3"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## <a id='4'>4. Covariate Shift</a>\n\nCovariate shift refers to the change in the distribution of the input variables present in the training and the test data. It is the most common type of shift and it is now gaining more attention as nearly every real-world dataset suffers from this problem.\n\nFirst, let us try to understand how does the change in distribution creates a problem for us. Take a look at the image shown below.\n \n <img src=\"http://i65.tinypic.com/2w4isyu.png\">\n \n If you carefully notice the image given above, our learning function tries to fit the training data. But here, we can see that the distribution of training and test is different, so predicting using this learned function will definitely give us wrong predictions.\n\nSo our first step should be to identify this shift in the distribution. Let’s try and understand it."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"4f7ab217afd9ccb3477976869c01a44791364ec2"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## <a id='5'>5. Identification</a>\n\nHere, I have used a quick and dirty machine learning technique to check whether there is a shift between the training data and the test data.\n\nFor this purpose, I have used Sberbank Russian Housing Market dataset.\n\n**The basic idea to identify shift ** \n\nIf there exists a shift in the dataset, then on mixing the train and test file, you should still be able to classify an instance of the mixed dataset as train or test with reasonable accuracy. Why?\n\nBecause, if the features in both the dataset belong to different distributions then, they should be able to separate the dataset into train and test file significantly.\n\nLet’s try to make it simple. Take a look at the distribution of the feature ‘id’ in both the dataset.\n <img src=\"http://i66.tinypic.com/2egd5z7.jpg\">\n \n By looking at the above distribution, we can clearly see that after a certain value (=30,473), all the instances will belong to test dataset.\n\nSo if we create a dataset which is a mixture of training and test instances, where we have labelled each instance of training data as ‘training’ and test as ‘test’ before mixing.\n\nIn this new dataset, if we just look at the feature ‘id’, we can clearly classify any instance that whether it belongs to training data or test data. Therefore, we can conclude that ‘id’ is a drifting feature for this dataset.\n\nSo this was fairly easy. But we can’t visualise every variable and check whether it is drifting or not.\n\nFor that purpose, let us try to code this in Python as a simple classification problem and identify the drifting features.\n\n### Steps to identify drift\n\nThe basic steps that we will follow are:\n\n- Preprocessing: This step involves imputing all missing values and label encoding of all categorical variables.\n- Creating a random sample of your training and test data separately and adding a new feature origin which has value train or test depending on whether the observation comes from the training dataset or the test dataset.\n- Now combine these random samples into a single dataset. Note that the shape of both the samples of training and test dataset should be nearly equal, otherwise it can be a case of an unbalanced dataset.\n- Now create a model taking one feature at a time while having ‘origin’ as the target variable on a part of the dataset (say ~75%).\n- Now predict on the rest part(~25%) of the dataset and calculate the value of AUC-ROC.\n- Now if the value of AUC-ROC for a particular feature is greater than **0.80**, we classify that feature as drifting.\n- Note that we generally take 0.80 as the threshold value, but the value can be altered based on the situation.\n\nSo that is enough of theory, now let’s code this and find which of the features are drifting in this problem."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"#
