aggregate outcomes for IDA countries for selected indicators. It includes key
country outcome indicators covering areas that are consistent with the
Millennium Development Goals, are priorities in many national development
plans and/or poverty reduction strategies, and reflect IDA's activities in IDA
countries. The indicators capture both the economic growth and the human
development priorities of ongoing IDA programs. Context This is a dataset
