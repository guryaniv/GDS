These included things like:\n* Are my Pandas operations as efficient as can be?\n* How do I keep my memory use from ballooning out of control?\n* What kind of cross validation should I use? And how do I implement it?\n* Choosing a learning rate and tuning hyperparameters.\n* Deciding how many boosting rounds to use during training.\n* Should I use only one, or multiple training rounds?\n* If more than one, how do I blend predictions from each training round?\n* And finally, exactly how do I create that CSV file that I'll need to submit?\n\nI wanted to publish this kernel in order create an example (both for my future self and for other beginners) of what it looks like to implement all the steps (preprocessing --> feature engineering --> cross validation --> training --> prediction generation --> post processing) that are necessary to build a (somewhat) competitive prediction algorithm. In other words, I wanted to demonstrate what it looks like to *\"put it all together.\"*\n\nThis is just single model LightGBM kernel, without any stacking. I'm planning to dive much deeper into stacking/blending/etc. in my next competition : )\n\nI am indebted to the generosity of the community at large, and in particular, to the wisdom and techniques shared by folks like  [Silogram](https://www.kaggle.com/psilogram), [olivier](https://www.kaggle.com/ogrellier), and [Laurae](https://www.kaggle.com/laurae2).\n\nAlthough I still consider myself to be a beginner who has a lot more to learn, these folks and their generosity have inspired me to do what little I can to give back. I hope that certain aspects of my code below, such as how my cross-validation method includes target encoding in a way that (I believe) prevents data leak, will be useful to others in the community. \n\nFinally, I welcome any tips and or feedback on my approach and implementation that follows below. Having one's blindspots pointed out to them is the surest way to growth and improvement  : )"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"85cf0aaa42e7a5e3837d7929da11c88aac928528"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Summary of My Kernel\n\nSingle model LightGBM with 1,275 features in total. Solo submission. This was my best performing kernel, though not my final submission (more later on as to why this was the case). `0.79581` local CV score. `0.79524` private LB score. `0.79831` public LB score:\n\n\n* I incorporated features from all seven of the data tables. I one-hot encoded categorical features from the bureau and previous application data tables. All other categorical features were left as categorical, and were ultimately target encoded. Some categorical features in the bureau and previous application tables were also target encoded.\n\n\n* I tried my best to isolate unhelpful features and drop them. This proved to be time-consuming and it was soon clear to me that the process of vetting features one-by-one would not scale to the size of the competition's featureset. I had tried using LightGBM and SelectKBest feature importances to guide me, but found that they were more of a red herring than anything else, in that those importances did not reliably predict how a feature's absence would affect my local CV's ROC AUC score.\n\n\n* I experimented with various types of scaling and normalization of numerical features, such as log-normalization, replacing NaN entries with 0, -1, -999999, etc., but found that none of these tweaks helped the performance of my LightGBM model. (This makes sense since LGBM is a tree-based model.)\n\n\n* Several of my engineered features were simple aggregations, using mean, sum, min, max, etc. At the same time, I created a handful of bespoke features that made intuitive sense to me. \n\n\n* Stratified 5-fold CV for model selection.\n\n\n* In addition to trying to add/remove features one-by-one, at times I tried adding/removing features in bulk (in the interest of saving time). It's not clear to me if one approach is necessarily better than the other all the time.\n\n  I would find that there were times I would add one feature, see my CV score drop, then add several more features, re-tune my model parameters, see the CV score improve, then try and remove that first feature that had originally lowered my CV score, only to see the CV score fall after the feature was removed. This experience only strengthened my hunch that successful data science has an element of artfulness and intuition.\n  \n\n* I used LightGBM's built-in CV for feature selection and hyperparameter tuning. It trains and makes predictions on each validation fold in parallel, so much time is saved over running serial K-fold CV. Unfortunately, lightgbm.cv doesn't currently support the kind of preprocessing inside CV folds that would be necessary to properly perform target encoding during CV without leakage. (Believe me, I tried.)\n\n\n* I found that using target encoding added just under 0.001 to my local CV and public LB scores. (Because lightgbm.cv doesn't support target encoding preprocessing for each fold, I had to use standard serial K-fold CV to do an apples-apples comparison of the performance of target encoding vs. merely using lightgbm's default categorical feature handling.)\n\n  Interestingly, it ultimately turned out that the private LB score of my model that used target encoding (with number of boosting rounds determined by serial CV) was only just under 0.0001 better than that of my model that used LightGBM's default handling of categorical features (and had its number of boosting rounds determined by lightgbm.cv). If I had it to do over again, I'm not sure I'd use target encoding.\n  \n\n* To generate test set predictions, I trained my final model five times, each time using a different random seed for my LightGBM parameters, and generated five sets of test predictions. I used mean ranking to blend the sets of predictions. The number of boosting rounds was equal to 110% of the average round of highest score across each of the CV folds.\n\n  Had I not used target encoding, I could have used lightgbm.cv and found the number of the actual single round where the average CV score across all folds was the highest. As it was, I had to settle for finding the round number of highest score for each of my five CV folds, and then take the average of those five round numbers.\n\n\n* I didn't experiment with any other sort of ensemble methods such as blending different model types, or stacking. I am saving that for my next competition :)\n\n\n### A Lesson I Learned About Overfitting to the Training Set:\nAs mentioned above, although this was my best performing kernel, it was only my second-to-final submission to the competition. In the final four days of the competition, I went on a spree of feature engineering/aggregation that more than doubled my feature count, arriving at a grand total of 2,782 features. This of course substantially decreased the speed of my data preprocessing and model training, but it did increase my local CV score from `0.79581` to `0.79665`. I figured the higher score was worth it and tagged that set of predictions as my final submission.\n\nUnfortunately, while doing this raised my public LB score from `0.79831` to `0.80003`, it turned out that it would eventually lower my private LB score from `0.79524` to `0.79506`. Thankfully, this wasn't too huge a drop, and I was still able to achieve a bronze medal and score within the top 8% of the competition with my `0.79506` submission. \n\nIn retrospect, although my local CV score did increase after adding all those extra features, I should have been suspicious because the difference between training and validation scores on each fold of my CV increased by nearly 50%. This was likely evidence that my model was now doing some serious overfitting in order to achieve that slight bump in local CV score.

The objective was to build an algorithm that could predict the likelihood that a loan applicant would eventually default on his or her loan. The training set contained various financial and personal information originally taken from the loan application profiles 307,511 previous Home Credit borrowers. The test set had 48,744 borrower records. The scoring metric was area under the ROC curve. Features were contained in seven different data tables. The largest table contained demographic information such as job type and gender, along with various numerical features that described a borrower's financial status, such as normalized credit rating scores. Each of the six supplementary data tables contained different kinds of detailed financial records. (e.g. credit card payment histories, loan payment histories recorded as recorded by the credit bureau, etc.)\n\nAs for the content of the dataset itself, several features were noticeably sparse, and it was clear to me early-on that I would need an algorithm that handled NaN entries as deftly as possible. Furthermore, some features had names and descriptions that were cryptic or vague at best. At times this made it tough to gain an intuition of how to best engineer new features. There were even two features that were incorrectly described as normalized even though they were clearly categorical (they contained word strings as entries). Finally, several features didn't always have missing values represented by np.nan. For some numerical features, the integer 365243 was equivalent to NaN. For certain categorical features, the strings 'XNA' or 'XAP' were used to denote missing entries. None of this information was included in the dataset's description, but was shared in the forum by Home Credit's liaison during the course of the competition.\n\nThese speedbumps added a certain element of challenge that helped to level the playing field. Namely, there seemed to be a larger than normal benefit to those teams taking the time to diligently explore and understand all the quirks and idiosyncrasies of the dataset. Simply having the most advanced stacking or ensembling methods would not be enough to guarantee victory in this competition.\n\nMost importantly, however, the consensus amongst competitors was that Home Credit's team went above and beyond in curating the test set such that data leak was minimized as much as possible. Furthermore, Home Credit's representative was active and responsive on the forums throughout the duration of the competition, and was helpful in clearing up questions that competitors had regarding the dataset and its feature definitions.\n\nAt the time of competition's conclusion, 7,198 teams had submitted entries, making this the largest ever featured competition in Kaggle's history. The [top team](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/discussion/64821) achieved a private leaderboard score of `0.80570`."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"84c6d208f0f134b8ab458617535cba4a9e13b8e8"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## My Journey Toward Participating in this Competition\n\nI began this competition in early June of 2018, in order to complete my [final project](https://github.com/jamesdellinger/machine_learning_nanodegree_capstone_project) for Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree.\n\nI spent about a month exploring the idiosyncracies of the main data table's (`application_{train|test}.csv`) 120 features, experimented with various single model predictors (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, AdaBoost, Multi-Layer Perceptron, and LightGBM), and alternately trained each of them on the table's full feature set, on just the top 30 features according to SelectKBest, and on a featureset where the dimensionality of the main table's numerical features was reduced using PCA. I compared the performance of each of these models using a simple 80%-20% train-validation set split. \n\nUltimately, my LightGBM single model that was trained on all 120 main table features performed the best, with a local CV score (ROC AUC) of `0.76092`. This translated to a public leaderboard score of `0.74111`. \n\nAt this point, I was pleased that I had put into practice several of the techniques and algorithms I had learned while completing the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree. However, I was by no means satisfied that I had done all I could do to build a kernel that was *competitive* on the Home Credit dataset.

They have initiated and participated in extended threads in the forums, where they patiently described the ins and outs of their approaches and implementations. They have also shared kernels that contain real, usable implementations of some of the most important techniques.

At the same time, I choose the highest possible learning rate (usually 0.2, 0.1, or 0.009) and then observe how the CV score changes as I adjust other hyperparameter values. \n\n\"Highest possible learning rate\" means: a learning rate that gives the model the chance to run for enough boosting rounds so that I can confirm that the model is incrementally learning from round to round. If the learning rate is too high, the model's score won't steadily improve from round to round, and we won't be able to observe how tuning other hyperparameters affects overall performance. If the learning rate is too low, we'll be taking an unnecessarily long time to make these observations.\n\nI like to tune hyperparameters one-by-one, and empirically observe how the CV score changes. Sometimes, but not that often, I will adjust pairs of hyperparameters together if I believe that the two hyperparameters have a unique interrelationship. I'm not a fan of computational tools like GridSearchCV. I find that simple, rote trial and error gives me a far stronger intuition about how the different hyperparameters are responding to my dataset and affecting CV score, in a much shorter amount of time than it takes GridSearchCV to finish churning through all the different hyperparamter combos while running on my laptop's CPU.\n\nLearning the fundamentals of decision trees, LightGBM specifically, and what each of its hyperparameters purports to do helped me to begin to be able to make mental shortcuts of know what hyperparameters to tune, and when and how to tune them.

This allows me to know the exact round when the average ROC AUC score across all folds was at its maximum.\n\nUnfortunately, lightgbm.cv doesn't support the kind of preprocessing of data within its folds that would be necessary to perform target encoding in a way that doesn't lead to data leakage. Nonetheless, with enough tuning of the parameters related to LightGBM's default handling of categorical features (in particular, reducing 'max_cat_threshold' from 32 to 4), I was able to get the CV score of lightgbm.cv to within 0.0002 below the CV score of my serial CV that computed the average best score across all folds.\n\nDue to its much more rapid training time, I found it helpful to use lightgbm.cv while adding/dropping/engineering new features and tuning hyperparameters. By enabling 'verbose_eval', lightgbm.cv gives me the clearest possible picture of how my choice of learning rate is affecting how my model learns overall. This was invaluable in helping me to decide on a good temporary learning rate to use when tuning all the other hyperparameters, as well as finding the optimal learning rate (low enough, but not too low) to use for final training and test prediction generation. \n\nFor this competition, I ultimately chose to use target encoding, which required me to implement standard, serial stratified K-Fold CV to get my final local CV score.

This is necessary in order to prevent data leakage.\n\n### Why I decided to use target encoding:\nPerforming serial cross validation is obviously much slower than using LightGBM's built-in CV, which trains and predicts on all five folds in parallel. However, after making the apples-to-apples comparison of performing serial CV, first using target encoding, and then again using LightGBM's default handling of categorical features, I found that I got a higher (by `0.001`) CV score when using target encoding. This was enough for me to conclude that accepting the limitations of not using lightgbm.cv was worth it as a tradeoff for the higher score I got using target encoding vs. not doing target encoding, all other conditions being held constant.\n\nThe single biggest trade-off, of course, is that using serial CV probably does a slightly worse job of approximating the true ideal number of boosting rounds for training my model, in that I can only know the *average round* of best score, as opposed to *the single round* when the *average score across* all 5 folds was best.\n\n### However, knowing what I know now:\nAs I mentioned in my comments at the beginning of this kernel, it would ultimately turn out that training a predictor using LightGBM's default categorical feature handling, where the number of boosting rounds was determined by the results of running lightgbm.cv, would result in a private LB score only just `0.0001` lower than the private LB score earned by my model that used target encoding and had its number of boosting rounds determined by the results of running serial CV. \n\nMy conclusion is that with the proper hyperparameter tuning, there may not be much advantage to using target encoding with LightGBM, at least not for the Home Credit competition's dataset."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"ce78229cd8ec342aa3563fae2727df8b231c9790"},"cell_type":"code","source":"def cross_validate(lgbm_params, X_train, y_train, n_folds, max_boost_rounds=500, \n                   early_stop_rounds=50, tme_min_samples_leaf=1, tme_smoothing=1, \n                   tme_noise_level=0, cv_random_seed=42):\n    \n    #
