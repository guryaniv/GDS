FastText is a word embedding not unlike Word2Vec or GloVe, but the cool thing is that each word vector is based on sub-word character n-grams. That means that even for previously unseen words (e.g. due to typos), the model can make an educated guess towards its meaning. To find out more about FastText, check out both their [Github](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText/) and [website](https://fasttext.cc/).\n\nTo do this, we won't be using the classic Keras embedding layer and instead hand-craft the embedding for each example. As a result, we need to  write more code and invest some time into preprocessing, but that is easily justified by the results.\n\n**Disclaimer: Loading the FastText model will take some serious memory! I recommend having at least 60 GB of RAM. EC2's p2.xlarge instance should have no problems with this, but you can always [add some swap](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17173972/how-do-you-add-swap-to-an-ec2-instance) for good measure. I also added a section below to build a training generator for this.**","outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"168f1efdabebb51c2922aab58231921599f9348f","_cell_guid":"b88f84eb-051c-4fe8-8fc0-70365a0b9693"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Preparations: Getting FastText and the model\n\nFirst, build FastText from sources as described [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText#requirements). Don't worry, there's nothing crazy you have to do and it will finish in less than a minute. Next, install the Python package in your virtualenv following [these instructions](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText/tree/master/python).\n\nFor the model, I use the one pretrained on English Wikipedia. I'd love to have one trained on Twitter or similar, since it might be more internet-slangy, but I haven't found any yet and don't feel like pretraining one myself. Download the model [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText/blob/master/pretrained-vectors.md). Make sure you get the bin, not just the vec (text) file. I'll assume you placed it (or a symlink to it) into your code directory and named it `ft_model.bin`.","outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"e4542f71483666b9168dacc6949bcbaff8b66642","_cell_guid":"eea9d34b-3205-421f-bfd8-6e29f8092ddd"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Preparations: Exploring the model\n\nLet's explore the model! Go to your FastText directory and run `./fasttext nn <path_to_ft_model>`. Now you can enter some terms and see the nearest neighbors to this word in the embedding space. Here are some examples:\n\n```\nQuery word? queen\n—queen 0.719091\n‘queen 0.692849\n#queen 0.656498\nqueena 0.650313\nking 0.64931\nqueen`s 0.63954\nking/queen 0.634855\ns/queen 0.627386\nprincess 0.623889\nqueeny 0.620919\n```\n\nOk that looks pretty ugly. I suppose Facebook was not very exact in their cleaning of the input data. But some sensible suggestions are there: `king` and `princess`! Let's try a typo that is unlikely to have appeared in the original data:\n\n```\nQuery word? dimensionnallity\ndimension, 0.722278\ndimensionality 0.708645\ndimensionful 0.698573\ncodimension 0.689754\ncodimensions 0.67555\ntwodimensional 0.674745\ndimension 0.67258\n\\,kdimensional 0.668848\n‘dimensions 0.665725\ntwo–dimensional 0.665109\n```\n\nSweet! Even though it has never seen that word, it recognizes it to be related with \"dimensionality\". Let's try some something mean:\n\n```\nQuery word? dumb\nstupid 0.746051\ndumber 0.732965\nclueless 0.662594\nidiotic 0.64993\nsilly 0.632314\nstupidstitious 0.628875\nstupidly 0.622968\nmoronic 0.621633\nignorant 0.620475\nstupider 0.617377\n```\n\nNice! Even though this was trained on Wikipedia, we're getting at least some basic insults. I'll leave it to you to explore the really hateful words. They all seem to be there ;)\n\n**Note:** Keep in mind that exploring the nearest neighbors is a very superficial approach to understanding the model! The embedding space has 300 dimensions, and we boil them down to a single distance metric. We can't be sure in which dimensions these words are related to each other, but we can trust in the model to have learnt something sensible.\n\n**Pro tip:** Our data should be cleaned and normalized in a similar way as Facebook did before they trained this model. We can query the model to get some insights into what they did, e.g.\n\n```\nQuery word? 1\ninsel 0.483141\ninseln 0.401125\n...\nQuery word? one\ntwo 0.692744\nthree 0.676568\n...\n```\n\nThis tells us they converted all numbers to their text equivalent, and so should we!","outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"ae7a32ce6f66748656faecde4d079857b992ac1e","_cell_guid":"2f03f7c4-ecc8-47d3-8c59-9e4482e7684a"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Loading and cleaning the data\n\nWe define a method `normalize` to clean and prepare a single string.

It seems I underestimated how much memory this monster model eats! Also, locally I had long [added swap space](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17173972/how-do-you-add-swap-to-an-ec2-instance) and switched to generators so I wouldn't have to keep the whole thing memory. Let me show you how to implement the generator part. This is also useful to add some randomization later on.\n\nThe idea is that instead of converting the whole training set to one large array, we can write a function that just spits out one batch of data at a time, infinitely. Keras can automaticaly spin up a separate thread for this method (note though that \"threads\" in Python are ridiculous and do not give any speedup whatsoever). This means that we have to write some more code and training will be slightly slower, but we need only a fraction of the memory and we can add some cool randomization to each batch later on (see ideas section below).\n\nWe can keep all the code from above.
