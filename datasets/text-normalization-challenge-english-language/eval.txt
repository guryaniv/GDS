Submissions are evaluated on prediction accuracy (the total percent of correct
tokens). The predicted and actual string must match exactly in order to count
as correct. In other words, we are measuring sequence accuracy, in that any
error in the output for a given token in the input sequence means that that
error is wrong. For example, if the input is "145" and the predicted output is
"one forty five" but the correct output is "one hundred forty five", this is
counted as a single error. Submission File For each token (id) in the test
set, you must predict the normalized text. The file should contain a header
and have the following format: id,after 0_0,"the" 0_1,"quick" 0_2,"fox" ...
