In order of increasing complexity, these are `concat`, `join`, and `merge`. Most of what `merge` can do can also be done more simply with `join`, so I will omit it and focus on the first two functions here.\n\nThe simplest combining method is `concat`. This function works just like the `list.concat` method in core Python: given a list of elements, it will smush those elements together along an axis.\n\nThis is useful when we have data in different `DataFrame` or `Series` objects but having the same fields (columns). One example: the [YouTube Videos dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new), which splits the data up based on country of origin (e.g. Canada and the UK, in this example).
