What does physics have in common with biology, cooking, cryptography, diy,
robotics, and travel? If you answered "all pursuits are governed by the
immutable laws of physics" we'll begrudgingly give you partial credit. If you
answered "all were chosen randomly by a scheming Kaggle employee for a twisted
transfer learning competition", congratulations, we accept your answer and
mark the question as solved. In this competition, we provide the titles, text,
and tags of Stack Exchange questions from six different sites. We then ask for
tag predictions on unseen physics questions. Solving this problem via a
standard machine approach might involve training an algorithm on a corpus of
related text. Here, you are challenged to train on material from outside the
field. Can an algorithm learn appropriate physics tags from "extreme-tourism
Antarctica"? Let's find out. Kaggle is hosting this competition for the data
science community to use for fun and education. This dataset originates from
the Stack Exchange data dump.
