I have tried to be as thorough as possible. If you have questions leave them in the comments and I will do my best to answer.\n\nFor this challenge we need to predict what direction a stock is going to move, and also weight our guess with a number between -1 and 1. The more confident you are, the more weight you should give it. E.g. if you are certain the stock will be up in ten days you assign a 1, if you're certain it will be down, -1, and for everything else something in between.\n\nThe  stock price can only go up or down on any given day so their probabilities must sum to 1. So P<sub>up</sub>+P<sub>down</sub>=1\n\nThe stock can also stay the same price, but the probability that it is exactly the same price is infinitesimal so we can neglect it. We can make a simple method for producing $\\hat{y}$ by subtracting P<sub>down</sub>  from P<sub>up</sub>: \n\n$\\hat{y}$=P<sub>up</sub>-P<sub>down</sub>=P<sub>up</sub>-(1-P<sub>up</sub>)=2P<sub>up</sub>-1\n\nWe can check if this makes sense. If we are certain the stock will go up P<sub>up</sub>=1 then $\\hat{y}$=1, likewise if we are certain it will go down P<sub>down</sub>=1 implies P<sub>up</sub>=0 and $\\hat{y}$=-1. Conveniently we are left predicting P<sub>up</sub> as a \"simple\" binary classification problem(which maps to the space [0,1]), for which there are a number of good tools."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":false,"scrolled":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom sklearn import *\nimport matplotlib\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom xgboost import XGBClassifier\nimport time\nfrom kaggle.competitions import twosigmanews\n\nenv = twosigmanews.make_env()\n(market_train, news_train) = env.get_training_data()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"f5a53d7503c04a4701c8242b74ac0c32aeee50c1"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The options below change how pandas displays things so that the dataframes we print will not omit rows/columns,  it can be a bit unwieldly but I think it's important to know what the data looks like and understand what exactly we are doing to it.

First we note that articles are generally urgent or not,  there are significantly less (10^-4) articles with a medium urgency, so this is almost a binary variable. \n\nbodySize, sentenceCount, and firstMentionSentence all have exponential distributions with significantly more shorter articles/earlier mentions. We should note though that the bins here are pretty large so if we break it down even finer we may find something different about the distribution.\n\nrelevance is clearly peaked at a value near 1 and then decays from 0 up suggesting articles are either directly relevant, or not really. This could be a good variable to cut on when deciding what articles to use for predicting asset results.\n\nsentimentClass shows a clear trend towards the positive and does a nice job of categorizing article sentiment in broad strokes. The categories sentimentNegative/Neutral/Positive break it down even further. The sentimentNegative plot appears fairly binary which is nice for us because it simplifies things. The sentimentNeutral plot is fairly flat apart from the first bin which is about what you'd expect, the first bin is very large which implies that the article is either strongly negative or positive. The sentimentPositive plot is a bit strange. We see a large spike near zero which is the negative articles, and a spike again near one for the unambiguously positive articles, but there's a strange spike around 0.5-0.6 that I am not sure how to interpret. Maybe these are tangentially related topics that could potentially be good for the business, cutting on the relevance criteria and replotting could maybe shed some light on that.\n\nsentimentWordCount, defined as \"the number of lexical tokens in the sections of the item text that are deemed relevant to the asset\", exhibits another exponential distribution where most articles have a significant amount of relevant material with less and less articles having less and less relevant \"lexical tokens.\"\n\nThe noveltyCount variable is defined a bit strangely it is: \"The 12 hour novelty of the content within a news item on a particular asset\". I'm interpreting this to mean how unique the article is, on a scale from 0-500. for the 24H plot it looks almost binary, that is articles are either very unique with a score ~500 or not very unique at all ~0. Comparing to the 7D variable we see a large amount of articles pop up on the lower end, so it looks like there are maybe new details about the news event coming out or new interpretations that are novel, but not completely unique coming out over the 7days after the news breaks.\n\nThe volumeCounts variables don't tell us too much interesting here. We see the 7D variable basically just a bit more beefed up so news breaks and then is covered a bit more in the following 6 days. This is what we would expect though so it is a good sanity check.\n\nSo now that we have a good handle on all our variables and have a decent understanding of what they do we may naturally want to merge our datasets. Unfortunately this is a bit tricky, since the datasets are organized a little differently. Our market data has a clear date, time, and assetcode associated with it, unfortunately our news data has multiple asset codes. In the first kernel I forked and started working with here: https://www.kaggle.com/jannesklaas/lb-0-63-xgboost-baseline the data is joined using the first entry from a list of the assetCodes. Unfortunately the assetCodes are stored as a category and have an ordering such that if you pull the first one, it does not necessarily match the assetcode used for the marketdata.

In short my solution for joining the dataframes was to duplicate the news rows for each assetCode present, and then let them drop out when we merge with the market data. There's also an issue about what to do with multiple news articles on the same day. One way to handle it is to simply aggregate it, perhaps by taking averages of the news variables, although we will lose some data if we do that. The downside to not aggregating is that if we have multiple entries for an assetCode on a single day, certain assetCodes or dates might make up a disproportionate amount of our training data, and we will have multiple predictions which we will have to turn in to one(which could increase or decrease our accuracy.)
