One of the possible reasons can be that the validation set is not a true representative of the test data. That means the input features (covariates) in our test data follow a different distribution compared to our validation/training data. This situation is also called ***Covariate Shift***. Here I'm discussing a method to identify whether covariate shift exist between the 2 datasets that we are comparing. I have also stated some ideas related to how we can adjust for this shift.\n", "\n", "This kernel is inspired by the following discussion: https://www.kaggle.com/c/porto-seguro-safe-driver-prediction/discussion/43453  and the code is borrowed from the following repository: https://github.com/erlendd/covariate-shift-adaption .

First, $p(X_{test})$ being on the numerator of $\\beta$ means that points in the training data that are close to high-density regions of the test data will be weighted-up. This makes a lot of sense intuitively. Second, the $p(X_{train})$ term on the demoninator of $\\beta$ actually reduces the contribution from training points that are in a high-density region of the training data. Therefore in a region of feature-space where the training and test distributions are very similar $\\beta$ will be close to one, and in more imbalanced regions $\\beta$ should vary compensate.\n", "\n", "How to actually use this? There are different ways to make use of this discussed in the literature. One method is using kernel means matching, to match the differing distributions. Another simpler method is by training a discriminative classifier to learn $p(X_{train}|D)$, for some data $D$.\n", "\n", "For an example of this in action, see below!\n", "\n"], "metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown"}, {"source": ["# Porto Seguro\u2019s Safe Driver Prediction\n", "I'm using data from this kaggle competition for exposition.\n", "https://www.kaggle.com/c/porto-seguro-safe-driver-prediction/data"], "metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown"}, {"outputs": [], "source": ["import matplotlib\n", "%matplotlib inline\n", "import seaborn as sns\n", "sns.set()\n", "import numpy as np\n", "import pandas as pd\n", "from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold as SKF\n", "from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression as LR\n", "from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\n", "from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score as AUC\n", "from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n", "import pylab as plt\n", "from sklearn_pandas import DataFrameMapper\n", "from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder, Imputer, StandardScaler\n", "from pandas.api.types import is_string_dtype, is_numeric_dtype\n", "from sklearn.ensemble import forest\n", "from sklearn.tree import export_graphviz"], "metadata": {"collapsed": true}, "cell_type": "code", "execution_count": 11}, {"source": ["## Data Loading "], "metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown"}, {"outputs": [], "source": ["#loading test and train data\n", "train = pd.read_csv('../input/unzippedraw/train.csv',low_memory=True)\n", "test = pd.read_csv('../input/unzippedraw/test.csv',low_memory=True)"], "metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "execution_count": 12}, {"outputs": [], "source": ["#making copy\n", "trn =  train.copy()\n", "tst =  test.copy()"], "metadata": {"collapsed": true}, "cell_type": "code", "execution_count": 13}, {"source": ["## Data Preparation"], "metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown"}, {"outputs": [], "source": ["#adding a column to identify whether a row comes from train or not\n", "tst['is_train'] = 0\n", "trn['is_train'] = 1 #1 for train"], "metadata": {"collapsed": true}, "cell_type": "code", "execution_count": 14}, {"outputs": [], "source": ["tst.shape,trn.shape"], "metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "execution_count": 15}, {"source": ["Test data has 892816 rows and train has 595212 rows.
