So 0:10 will select entries 0,...,9. `loc`, meanwhile, indexes inclusively. So 0:10 will select entries 0,...,10.\n\nWhy the change? Remember that loc can index any stdlib type: strings, for example. If we have a DataFrame with index values `Apples, ..., Potatoes, ...`, and we want to select \"all the alphabetical fruit choices between Apples and Potatoes\", then it's a heck of a lot more convenient to index `df.loc['Apples':'Potatoes']` than it is to index something like `df.loc['Apples', 'Potatoet]` (`t` coming after `s` in the alphabet).\n\nThis is particularly confusing when the `DataFrame` index is a simple numerical list, e.g. `0,...,1000`. In this case `df.iloc[0:1000]` will return 1000 entries, while `df.loc[0:1000]` return 1001 of them! To get 1000 elements using `loc`, you will need to go one lower and ask for `df.iloc[0:999]`. Earlier versions of this tutorial did not point this out explicitly, leading to a lot of user confusion on some of the related answers, so we've included this note here explaining this issue.\n\nOtherwise, the semantics of using `loc` are the same as those for `iloc`."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"f27de7a29f674f832b4f0bb2e924db0b1b8e7b44"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Manipulating the index\n\nLabel-based selection derives its power from the labels in the index.
