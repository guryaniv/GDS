Nice strategy but not applicable in this case\n- Changing the performance metric:\n    - Use the confusio nmatrix to calculate Precision, Recall\n    - F1score (weighted average of precision recall)\n    - Use Kappa - which is a classification accuracy normalized by the imbalance of the classes in the data\n    - ROC curves - calculates sensitivity/specificity ratio.\n- Resampling the dataset\n    - Essentially this is a method that will process the data to have an approximate 50-50 ratio.\n    - One way to achieve this is by OVER-sampling, which is adding copies of the under-represented class (better when you have little data)\n    - Another is UNDER-sampling, which deletes instances from the over-represented class (better when he have lot's of data)",

I will probably try to implement SMOTE in future versions of the code, but for now I will use traditional undersamplig.\n\n- The way we will under sample the dataset will be by creating a 50/50 ratio.

We could assing cost to misclassifications, but being interested in classifying \"1s\" correctly, the cost for misclassifying \"1s\" should be bigger than \"0\" misclassifications. After that, the algorithm would select the threshold which minimises the total cost. A drawback I see is that we have to manually select the weight of each cost... therefore, I will leave this know as a thought.\n- Going back to the threshold changing, there is an option which is the Precisio-Recall curve. By visually seeing the performance of the model depending on the threshold we choose, we can investigate a sweet spot where recall is high enough whilst keeping a high precision value.\n\n### Investigate Precision-Recall curve and area under this curve.",
