Submissions are evaluated using the multi-class logarithmic loss. Each image
has been labeled with one true species. For each image, you must submit a set
of predicted probabilities (one for every species). The formula is then,
logloss=− 1 N ∑ i=1 N ∑ j=1 M y ij log( p ij ), where N is the number of
images in the test set, M is the number of species labels, log is the natural
logarithm, y ij is 1 if observation i is in class j and 0 otherwise, and p ij
is the predicted probability that observation i belongs to class j . The
submitted probabilities for a given device are not required to sum to one
because they are rescaled prior to being scored (each row is divided by the
row sum), but they need to be in the range of [0, 1]. In order to avoid the
extremes of the log function, predicted probabilities are replaced with
max(min(p,1− 10 −15 ), 10 −15 ) . Submission File You must submit a csv file
with the image id, all candidate species names, and a probability for each
species. The order of the rows does not matter. The file must have a header
and should look like the following:
id,Acer_Capillipes,Acer_Circinatum,Acer_Mono,... 2,0.1,0.5,0,0.2,...
5,0,0.3,0,0.4,... 6,0,0,0,0.7,... etc.
