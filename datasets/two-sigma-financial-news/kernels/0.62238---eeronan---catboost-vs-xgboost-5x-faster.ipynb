(Note: assetCodeT in the CatBoost plot is the real assetCode, not the encoded label, I just didn't change the bin label) It's very likely this is due to the nature of however CatBoost is encoding the labels,  you can read about what it's doing here: https://tech.yandex.com/catboost/doc/dg/concepts/algorithm-main-stages_cat-to-numberic-docpage/  To me at least it's a  bit unclear how much of a good thing this is. Should whether an asset price goes up or down depend on who/what it is? It strikes me sort of like saying \"well Netflix stock always goes up.\" \n\nWe also see Volume is the 3rd most important predictor in XGBoost and the worst in CatBoost which is a bit strange. You'd think if it were good for one it should be good for both although it's unclear to me why volume would be a good predictor of a stock increasing or decreasing. I could see it being a good predictor of the confidence e.g. if a stock is being sold off, a high volume might imply that it is really being sold heavily and will end the day down signficantly.\n\nClose price is reasonably close in both models, 4th in XGB and 3rd in Cat.\n\nWe also see both models agree that returnsOpenPrevRaw10 and returnsOpenPrevMktres10 are fairly important. But why the return from ten days ago and not the return from yesterday? Does it have something to do with the fact that we are predicting ten days in the future? That would seem odd.\n\nOverall I wouldn't try to pull too much out of these plots. I think the disagreement between the two may indicate just how noisy the data is and how difficult it is to really find patterns in.\n\nI hope this was helpful and if you have any questions or think you can answer any of mine please comment!
