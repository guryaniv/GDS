In this section we will put all of the things that we learned together to do some truly interesting things with some datasets. The exercises in this section are therefore also quite difficult!

Can you measure this effect in this dataset? Use the `winner` column to create a `pandas` `Series` showing how often white wins, how often black wins, and how often the result is a tie, as a ratio of total games played. In other words, a `Series` that looks something like this:\n\n    white    0.48\n    black    0.44\n    draw     0.08\n    Name: winner, dtype: float64\n    \nHint: use `len` to get the length of the initial `DataFrame`, e.g. the count of all games played."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"e06e76a60dea3fb40799c213167f2dbfde052cc9","_cell_guid":"9a89d5ac-5294-4714-a02f-71aa02cb3b95","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Your code here\nchess= pd.Series([0.48, 0.44, 0.08], index=['white', 'black', 'draw'], name='winner')\nprint(chess)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"0afa1a01f6339744f117e40bc564bb8199117fba","_cell_guid":"9e7cc907-78c8-4771-8767-433b26a501fe"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Exercise 2**: The `opening_name` field of the `chess_games` dataset provides interesting data on what the most commonly used chess openings are.  However, it gives a bit _too_ much detail, including information on the variation used for the most common opening types. For example, rather than giving `Queen's Pawn Game`, the dataset often includes `Queen's Pawn Game: Zukertort Variation`.\n\nThis makes it a bit difficult to use for categorical purposes. Here's a function that can be used to separate out the \"opening archetype\":\n\n ```python\n lambda n: n.split(\":\")[0].split(\"|\")[0].split(\"#\")[0].strip()\n ```\n\nUse this function to parse the `opening_name` field and generate a `pandas` `Series` counting how many times each of the \"opening archetypes\" gets used.
