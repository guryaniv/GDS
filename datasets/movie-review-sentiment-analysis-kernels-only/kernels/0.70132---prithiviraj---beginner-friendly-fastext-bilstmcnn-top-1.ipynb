So logic like sentence tokenization based on periods or punctuations or something of that sort doesn't apply</li>\n<li>Certain phrases are **one worded with a sentiment 2**. (Obviously a sentiment 2 means neutral and if we trained using the words including the stop words it would be straight forward to classify a \"neutral\" sentiment.)</li>\n<li>For some phrases inclusion of a punctuation like a comma or a full stop changes the sentiment from say 2 to 3 i.e neutral to positive (we just have to leave our common sense out for analysing this data set I guess :-))</li>\n<li>Some phrases **starts** with a punctuation like a **backquote**. </li>\n<li>Some phrases **end** with a **punctuation** (i.e apart from a period)</li>\n<li>There are some residues of POS tagging left, you can occassionaly see **POST TAGS like -RRB-, -LRB-** in the phrases.</li>\n <li>Some phrases only had a **POST tag like a  -LRB- **:-)</li>\n</ul>\n    \n I told myself that  as much as there are some weird aspects to this dataset, these can be helpful and may be predictive.
