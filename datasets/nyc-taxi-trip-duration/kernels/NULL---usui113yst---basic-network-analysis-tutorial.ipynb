Are there any 'sensitive' roads on the path of a given taxi which may cause a longer trip time? These and more questions can be addressed by a network analysis. \n\nThis notebook uses graph data from this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/crailtap/street-network-of-new-york-in-graphml) , specific it makes use of the Manhattan subgraph, because computation times on the full graph would be to long for Kaggle Kernels. \n\nAlso i would like to encourage you to check out the awesome [OSMNX package](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx)\nfrom which i extracted the dataset and from which i make use of some functions. It is not available on Kaggle because it needs a Internet connection to download the graphs.\n\nThe rest of the notebook is structured as follows: First we take a look at some basic properties of the network, like how big is the network and start digging deeper to explore the generative process of the network and which roads may be important in a sense of high traffic volume and under the aspect of road closures aka attacks. Finally we will calculate useful features for the competition, like shortest paths and which boroughs it passes.\n\nHere is a sneak peak of the raw New York City Street Network!\n\n", "outputs": [], "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {"_execution_state": "idle", "_uuid": "d4246b380b3816fad755c24de74ab7e5e4b93710", "_cell_guid": "c440300c-50eb-4101-9af5-1403063368b5"}, "execution_count": null}, {"source": "![](http://i.imgur.com/6YJ6gV3.jpg)", "outputs": [], "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {"_uuid": "192943cd60bf68f688fd4a36368b4d0f7c82d7af", "_cell_guid": "61bf733a-8e70-4b1b-8e81-c90859203430"}, "execution_count": null}, {"source": "# 2.

Edges can be **directed** or ** undirected**. The number of nodes **N** is often called the **size** of the network and  states the number of objects in the model. In this example nodes are represented by way points in the OSM map from which the graph was generated, e.g., crossings and edges are roads or sub parts of roads between two nodes.\n\nEach node or edge can hold different attributes, e.g., nodes can be assigned to different types like crossings or dead-ends and edges might have a certain numerical attribute like a speed limit. Edges attributes, in the case of numerical attributes, are called weights. An graph with weighted edges is called an **weighted graph**.\n\nA first measurement for a node in the graph is the so called **degree**, which stands for the number of edges it has to other nodes, denoted by *k*.  One can also might ask what is the average degree in the network? But wait a second... if the degree is the number of edges it has to other nodes, don't we have to distinguish between directed and undirected edges to calculate the degree? Indeed, we need to distiguish between the **In-degree** and the **Out-degree** of a node, simply measuring how many edges are leaving a node and how many edges are coming in. This of cource depends on if the graph is direted or not.

Is the network random? or does it follow some underlying laws on how it is created.\n\nHere we introduce the **Scale-Free Property**, which states that 'real' networks do have a certain underlying creation process, like the WWW there some nodes do get more attention than others and therefore manage to build much more edges than other nodes., resulting in some nodes which have a much higher degree compared to other nodes. \n\nThese nodes with a very high degree in the network are called **hubs**. One can think of Twitter as a Social Network there prominent people represent hubs, having much more edges to other nodes than the average user.\nBut does our network follow the Scale-Free Property because it is a 'real' network?
