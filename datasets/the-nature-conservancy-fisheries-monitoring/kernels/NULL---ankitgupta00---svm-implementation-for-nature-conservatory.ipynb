It yields an Nx128 set of features, each extracted from detected keypoints in the image. The problem with SIFT, however, is that it is NOT open source. So, technically you need to pay royalties to its inventors in commercial applications.\n",
        " 2. **ORB** - OpenCV's open source alternative to SIFT. I have code for using ORB in the section below, as well. But the code may need to be restructured from Nx128 to NxM, depending on how many dimensions ORB gives you back for each feature.  More on ORB: http://www.willowgarage.com/sites/default/files/orb_final.pdf \n",
        " 3. **HoG (Histogram of Gradients)** - Another good option, this often used to find both people and animals in photos. More info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram_of_oriented_gradients \n",
        "\n",
        "The point here is: once features are extracted, we have essentially taken the the \"most important\" or \"distinctive\" keypoints from each image and mapped them into a higher dimensional space via our feature extraction method.\n",
        "\n",
        "We then feed our higher dimensional information vector into the SVM, along with a label, and we train the SVM on these data in our high-dimensional space. The SVM learns what boundaries mark distinctions between each class type, and so:  when we extract the features from a test image--using the same method--the hope is that the description vector takes us to an area in the feature space that is common to vectors taken from images of the same class-type. \n",
        "\n",
