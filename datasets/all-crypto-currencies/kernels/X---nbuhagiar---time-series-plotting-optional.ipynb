A lag plot compares data points from each observation in the dataset against data points from a previous observation.

In other words, a day of frantic trading does not necessarily signal that the next day will also involve frantic trading. In fact, there seem to be quite a few days of *extremely* high trading activity which stand out all alone!\n\nTime-series data tends to exhibit a behavior called **periodicity**: rises and peaks in the data that are correlated with time. For example, a gym would likely see an increase in attendance at the end of every workday, hence exhibiting a periodicity of a day. A bar would likely see a bump in sales on Friday, exhibiting periodicity over the course of a week. And so on.\n\nLag plots are extremely useful because they are a simple way of checking datasets for this kind of periodicity.\n\nNote that they only work on \"strong case\" timeseries data.\n\n### Autocorrelation plot\n\nA plot type that takes this concept and goes even further with it is the autocorrelation plot. The autocorrelation plot is a multivariate summarization-type plot that lets you check *every* periodicity at the same time. It does this by computing a summary statistic&mdash;the correlation score&mdash;across every possible lag in the dataset. This is known as autocorrelation.\n\nIn an autocorrelation plot the lag is on the x-axis and the autocorrelation score is on the y-axis. The farther away the autocorrelation is from 0, the greater the influence that records that far away from each other exert on one another.\n\nHere is what an autocorrelation plot looks like when applied to the stock volume data:"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"dd0568b1-61e6-4c6d-8eac-bd7807ee1656","_uuid":"5b2cd1f577a942bfe2934e6cd41fecda64894de4","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from pandas.plotting import autocorrelation_plot\n\nautocorrelation_plot(stocks['volume'])","execution_count":10,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"41dfb13c-1304-4c5c-b5a0-02543dea4d09","_uuid":"9a2b226b143dca2a563ffd082d504aa3810cc625"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"It seems like the volume of trading activity is weakly descendingly correlated with trading volume from the year prior.
