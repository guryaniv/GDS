(I know, I just flipped my metaphor from horses to sprinters).\n\nSurely it's as good as over - Prime Mover is untouchable. But wait! On December 6th, Farmers peeing further clearly had a breakthrough. They've made rapid improvements over the last couple of days, and could be on a trajectory to catch Prime Mover. Meanwhile, ultragamaza and Dodo Craze have both made rapid progress too, and now hold the 3rd and 4th spots\n\nWith over a month to go, it's still anybody's game."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"57eaf5e27678cb1637798816dc817933ce760aaf"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Update 2018-12-16"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"3707f1c23038ad8f08e0bff668a19cc5fd895364"},"cell_type":"code","source":"df2 = pd.read_csv('../input/leaderboard20181226/santa-leaderboard-2018-12-26.csv')\ndf2['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df2['SubmissionDate'])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"46ee54c839c3cde0953683192c474738f4011f05"},"cell_type":"code","source":"show_teams(df2, 1515750)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"58c2e22763b652372bf285a022684de0219b2a11"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Update 2019-01-09"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"c8cdf4abe878a63293d8fe8309802aa08283e985"},"cell_type":"code","source":"df3 = pd.read_csv('../input/santaleaderboard20190109/santa-leaderboard-2019-01-09.csv')\ndf3['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df3['SubmissionDate'])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"11228467862074da12704f1d911f76745557d080"},"cell_type":"code","source":"show_teams(df3, 1515150)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"d44e4a45fff4cdff1989be64e0e33b7b7f032ac7"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
