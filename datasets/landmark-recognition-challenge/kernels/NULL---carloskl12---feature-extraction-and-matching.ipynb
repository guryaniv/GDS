It's like the tip of a tower, or the corner of a window in the image above.  Unlike a random point on the background (sky) in the image above, the tip of the tower can be precise detected in most images of the same scene.  It is geometricly (translation, rotation, ...) and photometricly (brightness, exposure, ...) invariant.\n\nA good local feature is like the piece you start with when solving a jigsaw puzzle, except on a much smaller scale.  It's the eye of the cat or the corner of the table, not a piece on a blank wall.\n\n\nThe extracted local features [must be][lectures]:\n- *Repeatable* and *precise* so they can be extracted from different images showing the same object.\n- *Distinctive* to the image, so images with different structure will not have them.\n\n\nThere could be hundreds or thousands of such features in an image.  An image matcher algorithm could still work if some of the features are blocked by an object or badly deformed due to change in brightness or exposure.  Many local feature algorithms are highly efficient and can be used in real-time applications.\n\nDue to these requirements, most local feature detectors extract corners and blobs.\n\n## Local Feature Detection and Description\nThere is a wealth of algorithms satisfying the above requirements for feature detection (finding interest points on an image) and description (generating a vector representation for them).  They include [Harris Corner Detection][harris], [Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT)][sift], [Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF)][surf], [Features from Accelerated Segment Test (FAST)][fast], and [Binary Robust Independent Elementary Features (BRIEF)][brief].\n\nIn this tutorial, we will use [Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB)][orb] for feature detection and description.  This algorithm was [developed][orb_paper] and [implemented][orb] by OpenCV Labs, and it's part of their [OpenCV library][opencv_lib] for computer vision.\n\nLet's start by extracting the local features of the image shown in the banner above.
