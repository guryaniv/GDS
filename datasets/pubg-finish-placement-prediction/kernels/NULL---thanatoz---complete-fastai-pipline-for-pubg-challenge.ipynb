In this notebook, I will try to explain you the fastai implementation using the fastai version 0.7.0. Though I may plan to use the recent fastai version in future notebook if I get a good response for this notebook. We will perform some EDA to understand the nature of data but will not peek into the data as this is not considered as a good practice while working with the data. I believe that this notion is kept in mind so that we do not create a model to overfit the data. If you feel that this requires any changes, feel free to comment and I will try to correct it ASAP.\n\n### A little about PUBG data\nWe all love PUBG just like we love Data Science. When the team at [PUBG](https://www.pubg.com/) decided to make official game data available for the public to explore and scavenge outside of \"The Blue Circle.\", it became a great opportunity to look into the game stats and data of global users and play with the same.\n\n> Kaggle mentions \"This competition is not an official or affiliated PUBG site - Kaggle collected data made possible through the [PUBG Developer API](https://developer.pubg.com/).\"\n\n# Understanding the contest\nWe are provided with a large number of anonymized PUBG game stats, formatted so that each row contains one player's post-game stats. The data comes from matches of all types: *solos*, *duos*, *squads*, and *custom*; there is no guarantee of there being 100 players per match, nor at most 4 player per group.\n\nWe are required to predict the **\"winPlacePerc\"** which corresponds to the percentage prediction that a player is going to have a **Chicken Dinner** or not.\n\n### Evaluation\nThe contest wants use to minimize the [Mean Absolute Error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_absolute_error) given by the following formula $$MAE = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} | y_i - x_i | }{n}$$\n\n### Having a look at the data"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"2edf3181db51874fc4a75f17232412ae62545da8"},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\ntrain = pd.read_csv('../input/train_V2.csv')\ntest = pd.read_csv('../input/test_V2.csv')\nprint(f\"The training dataset contains {len(train.Id)} rows and {len(train.columns)} columns\")\nprint(f\"and the testing dataset contains {len(test.Id)} rows and {len(test.columns)} columns\")\ntrain.tail()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8255f86c0370a92a04b7d30e3845606a6770c322"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We can see that the *train_V2.csv* contains **4446965** rows of data each having **29** columns. and the *test_V2.csv* contains ** ** rows and **28** columns.\n\nThe data description does defines the meaning of each column but let me make it a bit redundant for you by mentioning it here itself so that you don't have to go back to the competition page:\n### Data fields\n\n*  **Id** - Player’s Id\n* **groupId** - ID to identify a group within a match. If the same group of players plays in different matches, they will have a different groupId each time.\n* **matchId** - ID to identify match. There are no matches that are in both the training and testing set.\n*  **assists** - Number of enemy players this player damaged that were killed by teammates.\n*  **boosts** - Number of boost items used.\n*  **damageDealt** - Total damage dealt. Note: Self inflicted damage is subtracted.\n*  **DBNO\ts** - Number of enemy players knocked.\n*  **headshotKills** - Number of enemy players killed with headshots.\n*  **heals** - Number of healing items used.\n*  **killPlace** - Ranking in match of number of enemy players killed.\n*  **killPoints** - Kills-based external ranking of player. (Think of this as an Elo ranking where only kills matter.) If there is a value other than -1 in rankPoints, then any 0 in killPoints should be treated as a “None”.\n* **kills** - Number of enemy players killed.\n*  **killStreaks** - Max number of enemy players killed in a short amount of time.\n* **longestKill** - Longest distance between player and player killed at time of death. This may be misleading, as downing a player and driving away may lead to a large longestKill stat.\n* **matchDuration** - Duration of match in seconds.\n* **matchType** - String identifying the game mode that the data comes from. The standard modes are “solo”, “duo”, “squad”, “solo-fpp”, “duo-fpp”, and “squad-fpp”; other modes are from events or custom matches.\n* **maxPlace** - Worst placement we have data for in the match. This may not match with numGroups, as sometimes the data skips over placements.\n* **numGroups** - Number of groups we have data for in the match.\n* **rankPoints** - Elo-like ranking of player. This ranking is inconsistent and is being deprecated in the API’s next version, so use with caution. Value of -1 takes place of “None”.\n* **revives** - Number of times this player revived teammates.\n* **rideDistance** - Total distance traveled in vehicles measured in meters.\n* **roadKills** - Number of kills while in a vehicle.\n* **swimDistance** - Total distance traveled by swimming measured in meters.\n* **teamKills** - Number of times this player killed a teammate.\n* **vehicleDestroys** - Number of vehicles destroyed.\n* **walkDistance** - Total distance traveled on foot measured in meters.\n* **weaponsAcquired** - Number of weapons picked up.\n* **winPoints** - Win-based external ranking of player. (Think of this as an Elo ranking where only winning matters.) If there is a value other than -1 in rankPoints, then any 0 in winPoints should be treated as a “None”.\n* **winPlacePerc** - The target of prediction. This is a percentile winning placement, where 1 corresponds to 1st place, and 0 corresponds to last place in the match. It is calculated off of maxPlace, not numGroups, so it is possible to have missing chunks in a match."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"82dec4681d2514434441802386cb514bcb42c722"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Data Visualization\nWe are now going to perform some EDA on the data just to get the gist of what kind of data we are dealing with.
