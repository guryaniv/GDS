        "Spacy is a great tool and there is already some pretty detailed kernel on it. Yet I didn't find them easy to understand for someone new to spacy. My intend here is to make it as clear and direct as possible.\n",

        "My initial goal was actually to find something that would make the question more similar to Chinese. For the basis I have in Chinese one would say: I eat, he eat, yesterday he eat, tomorrow they eat, etc. The verb do not change and yet we perfectly understand the meaning of the sentence. The lemmatizer offered with spacy gave me a very similar result and added some perks (ex: removing plurals)\n",
