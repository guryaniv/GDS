This huge imbalance brings up challenges when trying to accurately predict whether or not a transaction is fradulent. This notebook will take a quick look at using a sampling method called SMOTE, or Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique, as a way to generate new observations from the minority class in hopes of helping the performance of the model.

The credit card company, within reason, would rather classify a non-fraudulent transaction as fraudulent (and investigate it later to find out it was a false alarm) than miss an actual fraudulent case. When we take this into consideration, recall, or the true positive rate, is the score we should be evaluating our model with. \n\nAgain, the SMOTE algorithm randomly creates new minority classes by generating features that are a weighted combination of the features of a minority sample and the features of its kth nearest neighbors. With cross validation, it is important that that train-validation sets are created prior to implementing SMOTE so that the synthetic points are created using only the training portion and no information from the validation set is leaking in. I was having issues getting this to work, but luckily I ran into this [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48370150/how-to-implement-smote-in-cross-validation-and-gridsearchcv) on stackoverflow to add SMOTE correctly into the pipeline. Again, my function returns the optimal model fitted on the entire training set, with SMOTE applied too I believe. The optimal model is one that uses ridge regularization with 0.01 as the value for C. \n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"6a626f29808470953683ed8452d2c97880d1e81b","_cell_guid":"3dd48285-0acd-48d9-82fb-eb83ec598cf7","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"smt = SMOTE()\nlog_model = LogisticRegression()\n\nsteps = [('smote', smt), ('mod', log_model)]\npipeline = Pipeline(steps)\n\nc_param_grid = {'mod__C': [0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100], 'mod__penalty': ['l1', 'l2']}\nbest_mod = get_opt_model(pipeline, c_param_grid, X_train_sc, y_train, scoring = 'recall')","execution_count":15,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"b62d466569b2e2bdea57fadc1e59c714247528f8"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Here, I evaluate the chosen model on the hold out test set.

We can adjust this probability threshold and label a prediction as fraud at a different probability level. From there, we can see how the recall and precision scores are affected. \n\nFrom the output below, we can see that as the threshold increases, the recall starts to drop and the precision rises. What's interesting to note is that the recall doesn't drop drastically. Thinking about it, that must mean that the probabilities for the fraudulent transactions predicted by the model are relatively high. That is, the probabilities for predicted fraud are high enough that increasing the probability threshold does not cause a prediction to go from being one that's correctly predicted as fraud to one that's incorrectly predicted as not fraud. So our model must have pretty good certainty that a transaction is fraud when it is indeed fraud. So depending on what levels of recall and precision we're okay at can help us determine what probability threshold to use.
