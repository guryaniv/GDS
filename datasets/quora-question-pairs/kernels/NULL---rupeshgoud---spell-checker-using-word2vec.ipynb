Here is the solution I am using now.\n\nIt is an adaptation of Peter Norvig's spell checker.  It uses word2vec ordering of words to approximate word probabilities.  Indeed, Google word2vec apparently orders words in decreasing order of frequency in the training corpus.\n\nThis kernel requires to download Google's word2vec: https://github.com/mmihaltz/word2vec-GoogleNews-vectors .  I have put it in my ../data directory.\n\nI don't think that  the notebooks can run on Kaggle kernels but I share it anyway as many have already downloaded the word2vec embedding."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"1d7bd7dc-bae7-4313-856b-bdc10e447644","_uuid":"f2af10e787d679b4a3746f38d78b55ca6a787b45","trusted":false,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory\n\nfrom subprocess import check_output\nprint(check_output([\"ls\", \"../input\"]).decode(\"utf8\"))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"36d0c3a7-e625-44d9-6f71-ae8df520a1cb","_uuid":"c507e8eaef47d68095189ab9e55ad95e85907e76","trusted":false,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import gensim\nmodel = gensim.models.KeyedVectors.load_word2vec_format('../data/GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin.gz', \n                                                        binary=True)\n\nwords = model.index2word\n\nw_rank = {}\nfor i,word in enumerate(words):\n    w_rank[word] = i\n\nWORDS = w_rank","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"e9756896-0a0a-81d0-66d9-821f7cdc8281","_uuid":"5d3ddc97f476b05cfe90f91de92cbb19c9bf208a"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The rest of the code is a simple modification of Peter Norvig's code.
