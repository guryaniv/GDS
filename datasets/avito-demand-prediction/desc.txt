When selling used goods online, a combination of tiny, nuanced details in a
product description can make a big difference in drumming up interest. Details
like: And, even with an optimized product listing, demand for a product may
simply not exist–frustrating sellers who may have over-invested in marketing.
Avito, Russia’s largest classified advertisements website, is deeply familiar
with this problem. Sellers on their platform sometimes feel frustrated with
both too little demand (indicating something is wrong with the product or the
product listing) or too much demand (indicating a hot item with a good
description was underpriced). In their fourth Kaggle competition, Avito is
challenging you to predict demand for an online advertisement based on its
full description (title, description, images, etc.), its context
(geographically where it was posted, similar ads already posted) and
historical demand for similar ads in similar contexts. With this information,
Avito can inform sellers on how to best optimize their listing and provide
some indication of how much interest they should realistically expect to
receive.
