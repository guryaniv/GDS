Before asking someone on a date or skydiving, it's important to know your
likelihood of success. The same goes for quoting home insurance prices to a
potential customer. Homesite, a leading provider of homeowners insurance, does
not currently have a dynamic conversion rate model that can give them
confidence a quoted price will lead to a purchase. Using an anonymized
database of information on customer and sales activity, including property and
coverage information, Homesite is challenging you to predict which customers
will purchase a given quote. Accurately predicting conversion would help
Homesite better understand the impact of proposed pricing changes and maintain
an ideal portfolio of customer segments.
