Students ask questons on the CareerVillage.org platform and Professionals answer them. CareerVillage.org has a pretty good recommendation system inplace that's based on hard-coded rules. They would love to make it more efficient and improve it's performance. That's where you come in :)\n\nSince questions and answers are the main focus of this competition, I thought it would be helpful to join a few tables together to help get things started. This is totally not an exhaustive list of things to do and there's a lot more data to explore so go get wild!\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"924ef47ae24cee620184bd25bf8417d80c3fd1a4"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"It's all about questions and answer and how to make proper recommendations so these tables might be a good palce to start:\n\n- questions.csv\n- answers.csv\n- professionals.csv"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"questions = pd.read_csv('../input/questions.csv')\nanswers = pd.read_csv('../input/answers.csv')\nprofessionals = pd.read_csv('../input/professionals.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"3d3d926a781225153b08a93ea46702f6b52a55df"},"cell_type":"code","source":"questions.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"070e948e404a1eef4436211be3796948b2f3b007"},"cell_type":"code","source":"answers.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"ea84532895b00decd468d13adae89aca428cab05"},"cell_type":"code","source":"professionals.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"5d16e18fc05708121567003d4516d1ee72b95173"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"First I'll join questions and answers together.
