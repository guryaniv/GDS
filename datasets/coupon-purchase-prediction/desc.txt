Recruit Ponpare is Japan's leading joint coupon site, offering huge discounts
on everything from hot yoga, to gourmet sushi, to a summer concert bonanza.
Ponpare's coupons open doors for customers they've only dreamed of stepping
through. They can learn difficult to acquire skills, go on unheard of
adventures, and dine like (and with) the stars. Investing in a new experience
is not cheap. We fear wasting our time and money on a product or service that
we may not enjoy or fully understand. Ponpare takes the high price out of this
equation, making it easier for you to take the leap towards your first sky-
dive or diamond engagement ring. Using past purchase and browsing behavior,
this competition asks you to predict which coupons a customer will buy in a
given period of time. The resulting models will be used to improve Ponpare's
recommendation system, so they can make sure their customers don't miss out on
their next favorite thing.
