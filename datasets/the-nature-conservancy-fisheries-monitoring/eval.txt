Submissions are evaluated using the multi-class logarithmic loss. Each image
has been labeled with one true class. For each image, you must submit a set of
predicted probabilities (one for every image). The formula is then, logloss=−
1 N N ∑ i=1 M ∑ j=1 yijlog(pij), where N is the number of images in the test
set, M is the number of image class labels, log is the natural logarithm, yij
is 1 if observation i belongs to class j and 0 otherwise, and pij is the
predicted probability that observation i belongs to class j . The submitted
probabilities for a given image are not required to sum to one because they
are rescaled prior to being scored (each row is divided by the row sum). In
order to avoid the extremes of the log function, predicted probabilities are
replaced with max(min(p,1−10−15),10−15) . Submission File You must submit a
csv file with the image file name, and a probability for each class. The 8
classes to predict are: 'ALB', 'BET', 'DOL', 'LAG', 'NoF', 'OTHER',
'SHARK','YFT' The order of the rows does not matter. The file must have a
header and should look like the following:
image,ALB,BET,DOL,LAG,NoF,OTHER,SHARK,YFT img_00001.jpg,1,0,0,0,0,...,0
img_00002.jpg,0.3,0.1,0.6,0,...,0 ...
