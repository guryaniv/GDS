Can you differentiate a weed from a crop seedling? The ability to do so
effectively can mean better crop yields and better stewardship of the
environment. The Aarhus University Signal Processing group, in collaboration
with University of Southern Denmark, has recently released a dataset
containing images of approximately 960 unique plants belonging to 12 species
at several growth stages. We're hosting this dataset as a Kaggle competition
in order to give it wider exposure, to give the community an opportunity to
experiment with different image recognition techniques, as well to provide a
place to cross-pollenate ideas. Acknowledgments We extend our appreciation to
the Aarhus University Department of Engineering Signal Processing Group for
hosting the original data. Citation A Public Image Database for Benchmark of
Plant Seedling Classification Algorithms
