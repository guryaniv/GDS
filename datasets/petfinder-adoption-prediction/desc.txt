Millions of stray animals suffer on the streets or are euthanized in shelters
every day around the world. If homes can be found for them, many precious
lives can be saved — and more happy families created. PetFinder.my has been
Malaysia’s leading animal welfare platform since 2008, with a database of more
than 150,000 animals. PetFinder collaborates closely with animal lovers,
media, corporations, and global organizations to improve animal welfare.
Animal adoption rates are strongly correlated to the metadata associated with
their online profiles, such as descriptive text and photo characteristics. As
one example, PetFinder is currently experimenting with a simple AI tool called
the Cuteness Meter, which ranks how cute a pet is based on qualities present
in their photos. In this competition you will be developing algorithms to
predict the adoptability of pets - specifically, how quickly is a pet adopted?
If successful, they will be adapted into AI tools that will guide shelters and
rescuers around the world on improving their pet profiles' appeal, reducing
animal suffering and euthanization. Top participants may be invited to
collaborate on implementing their solutions into AI tools for assessing and
improving pet adoption performance, which will benefit global animal welfare.
Important Note Be aware that this is being run as a Kernels Only Competition,
