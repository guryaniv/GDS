Although the dataset doesn't include a specific field for this information, many of the wines reviewed by are from a series of wines specific to a given growing season and hence, year (or \"vintage\").

The `title` of the wine often mentions the vintage.\n\nCreate a `Series` showing, for each wine, what vintage (year) the wine comes from. Do this by extracting the year, if one occurs, from the `title` field of the dataset. Report wines missing vintages as `N/A`. Sort the values in ascending order (e.g. earlier years before later ones).\n\nHint: write a map that will extract the vintage of each wine in the dataset.
