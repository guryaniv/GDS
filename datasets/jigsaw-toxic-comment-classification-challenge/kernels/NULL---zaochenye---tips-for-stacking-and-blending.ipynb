There is a variety of ensembling or stacking methods, from simple ones like voting or averaging the predictions, to building complex learning models (logistic regressions, k-nearest neighbours, boosting trees) using the predictions as features.\n\nEnsembling or stacking of machine learning model predictions very often beat state-of-the-art academic benchmarks and are widely used to win Kaggle competitions. On the downside, they are usually computationally expensive, but if time and resources are not an issue, a minimal percentage improvement in predictive performance could, for example, help companies save a lot of money.\n\nWhere can you learn about stacking and ensembling of models?\n\nI have found the Kaggle ensembling guide blog by one of Kaggle top competitors very useful as a starting point to discover the different methods in which predictions from individual models can be combined to improve predictive accuracy. In this blog, the author describes a variety of stacking methods, and how he and his team have used them to win Kaggle competitions. In addition, he provides a number of resources for further reading.\n\nTo perform stacking methods, it is not essential to learn new techniques, algorithms or concepts. Instead, you use what you already know in a creative way to improve the performance of individual algorithms. In this sense, knowing what other scientists have successfully implemented in different predictive scenarios helps understand the variety and the potential of what can be done by combining predictors creatively.\n\nSome interesting reads include the following (many of them recommended in the Kaggle ensembling guide blog):\n* [Stacked Generalization](https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00117832), DH Wolpert, Neural Networks, 1992.
