This represents the\nprinciple amount of the loan.\n\nBy understanding the loan amounts we will be able to see what types of loans do the best for LC and\nwhich have the highest rates of return."

I assume that such a rapid growth curve in the number of \nloans will be accompanied by a decrease in the overall quality of the loans.\n\n- There does appear to be some seasonal trends in the number of loans given within the year. \nThere peaks occuring in July and October which show small trending build ups between months. It is hard\nto say if these seasonal trends are the same by year, we would have to break the monthly loans down\ninto years. This will be done as follows."
