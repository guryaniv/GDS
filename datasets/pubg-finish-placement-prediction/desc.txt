So, where we droppin' boys and girls? Battle Royale-style video games have
taken the world by storm. 100 players are dropped onto an island empty-handed
and must explore, scavenge, and eliminate other players until only one is left
standing, all while the play zone continues to shrink. PlayerUnknown's
BattleGrounds (PUBG) has enjoyed massive popularity. With over 50 million
copies sold, it's the fifth best selling game of all time, and has millions of
active monthly players. The team at PUBG has made official game data available
for the public to explore and scavenge outside of "The Blue Circle." This
competition is not an official or affiliated PUBG site - Kaggle collected data
made possible through the PUBG Developer API. You are given over 65,000 games'
worth of anonymized player data, split into training and testing sets, and
asked to predict final placement from final in-game stats and initial player
ratings. What's the best strategy to win in PUBG? Should you sit in one spot
and hide your way into victory, or do you need to be the top shot? Let's let
the data do the talking!
