"Quick, Draw!" was released as an experimental game to educate the public in a
playful way about how AI works. The game prompts users to draw an image
depicting a certain category, such as ”banana,” “table,” etc. The game
generated more than 1B drawings, of which a subset was publicly released as
the basis for this competition’s training set. That subset contains 50M
drawings encompassing 340 label categories. Sounds fun, right? Here's the
challenge: since the training data comes from the game itself, drawings can be
incomplete or may not match the label. You’ll need to build a recognizer that
can effectively learn from this noisy data and perform well on a manually-
labeled test set from a different distribution. Your task is to build a better
classifier for the existing Quick, Draw! dataset. By advancing models on this
dataset, Kagglers can improve pattern recognition solutions more broadly. This
will have an immediate impact on handwriting recognition and its robust
applications in areas including OCR (Optical Character Recognition), ASR
(Automatic Speech Recognition) & NLP (Natural Language Processing).
