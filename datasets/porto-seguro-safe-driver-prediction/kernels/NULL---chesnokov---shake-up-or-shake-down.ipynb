This notebook based on [nice exploration](https://www.kaggle.com/vpaslay/is-your-small-gini-significant) of how many samples should be guessed additionally to get an improvement of 0.001 of gini score and a [discussion](https://www.kaggle.com/vpaslay/is-your-small-gini-significant#244525) below it.
