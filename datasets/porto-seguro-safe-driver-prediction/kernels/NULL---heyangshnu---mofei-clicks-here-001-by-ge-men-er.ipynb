I made the plot gragh. The above graph shows the target value in train data file are either 1 or 0. Uh-Oh:(\n\nBut, in the sample_submission file, they have all the target value as 0.0364. Do you think it's a hint for us, the value could be any REAL value between [0,1]? \nOr we just rougly tend to think every driver's skill is as bad as YANG LAO SHI's. Thus, when target value less or equal than 0.5, we would give a piecewise to make it equals to 0 and elsewhere equals to 1.\n\nI also find a smiliar discussion on https://www.kaggle.com/c/porto-seguro-safe-driver-prediction/discussion/40222\n, please search rkoptelov or Daniel Moller.\n\n>>**HY Answer:** You can write anything here, such as agree:) Seriously, we can see the precentage of 0 and 1 are very different, probably 9:1. Do you think 0 means having a claim or not? Or it doesn't matter??? But how could that work?!\n\n**Q2: What's the meaning of the other columns?**\n\nWe observed the column name is a combination of three or four parts, the fourth part(if has) could be cat or bin.\n\nI find this answer from the** data description**. \n\n2.1  In the train and test data, features that belong to similar groupings are tagged as such in the feature names (e.g., ind, reg, car, calc). \n\n2.2 In addition, feature names include the postfix** bin to indicate binary features and cat to indicate categorical features**.\n\n2.3  **Features without these designations are either continuous or ordinal**. Values of **-1** indicate that the feature was **missing** from the observation. \n\n>>Do you think we can do more in this part to understand features better, such as same first two parts, compute coefficient or we will compute each two anyhow.

The 0 means a driver will not initiate an auto insurance claim in the next year, And 1 means the opposite situation. For test set, we should give the probability that a driver will initiate an auto insurance claim in the next year.
