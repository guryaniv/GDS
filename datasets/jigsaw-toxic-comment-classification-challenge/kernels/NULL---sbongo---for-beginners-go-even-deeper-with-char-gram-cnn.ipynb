When we train our model using the word vectors from our training set, we might be missing out some genuine words and mispellings that are not present in the training set but yet present in our prediction set. Sometimes that wouldn't affect the model's capability to make good judgement, but most of the time, it's unable to correctly classify because the misspelt words are not in the model's \"dictionary\". \n\nHence, if we could \"go deeper\" by splitting the sentence into a list of characters instead of words, the chances that the same characters that are present in both training and prediction set are much higher. You could imagine that this approach introduce another problem: an explosion of dimensions. One of the ways to tackle this problem is to use CNN as it's designed to solve high-dimensional dataset like images. Traditionally, CNN is used to solve computer vision problems but there's an increased trend of using CNN not just in Kaggle competitions but also in papers written by researchers too. Therefore, I believe it deserve a writeup and without much ado, let's see how we can apply CNN to our competition at hand.\n\nI have skipped some elaboration of some concepts like embeddings which I have went through in my previous notebooks, so take a look at these if you are interested in learning more:\n\n* [Do Pretrained Embeddings Give You The Extra Edge?](https://www.kaggle.com/sbongo/do-pretrained-embeddings-give-you-the-extra-edge)\n* [[For Beginners] Tackling Toxic Using Keras](https://www.kaggle.com/sbongo/for-beginners-tackling-toxic-using-keras)","outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"c0194529a65abc69d715a68abd061c160471081b","_cell_guid":"efe8078f-d485-44f2-b9d7-f541d8243828"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**A brief glance at Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs)**\n\nCNN is basically a feed-forward neural network that consists of several layers such as the convolution, pooling and some densely connected layers that we are familiar with.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/aa46tRe.png)\n\nFirstly, as seen in the above picture, we feed the data(image in this case) into the convolution layer. The convolution layer works by sliding a window across the input data and as it slides, the window(filter) applies some matrix operations with the underlying data that falls in the window. And when you eventually collect all the result of the matrix operations, you will have a condensed output in another matrix(we call it a feature map).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/wSbiLCi.gif)\n\nWith the resulting matrix at hand, you do a max pooling that basically down-samples or in another words decrease the number of dimensions without losing the essence. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Cphci9k.png)\n\nConsider this simplified image of max pooling operation above. In the above example, we slide a 2 X 2 filter window across our dataset in strides of 2. As it's sliding, it grabs the maximum value and put it into a smaller-sized matrix.\n\nThere are different ways to down-sample the data such as min-pooling, average-pooling and in max-pooling, you simply take the maximum value of the matrix. Imagine that you have a list: [1,4,0,8,5]. When you do max-pooling on this list, you will only retain the value \"8\". Indirectly, we are only concerned about the existence of 8, and not the location of it. Despite it's simplicity, it's works quite well and it's a pretty niffy way to reduce the data size.\n\nAgain, with the down-sized \"after-pooled\" matrix, you could feed it to a densely connected layer which eventually leads to prediction.\n\n**How does this apply to NLP in our case?**\n\nNow, forget about real pixels about a minute and imagine using each tokenized character as a form of pixel in our input matrix. Just like word vectors, we could also have character vectors that gives a lower-dimension representation. So for a list of 10 sentences that consists of 50 characters each, using a 30-dimensional embedding will allow us to feed in a 10x50x30 matrix into our convolution layer.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/g59nKYc.jpg)\nLooking at the above picture, let's just focus(for now) on 1 sentence instead of a list. Each character is represented in a row (8 characters), and each embedding dimension is represented in a column (5 dimensions) in this starting matrix.\n\nYou would begin the convolution process by using filters of different dimensions to \"slide\" across your initial matrix to get a lower-dimension feature map. There's something I deliberately missed out earlier: filters. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Lwa7wBG.gif)\nThe sliding window that I mention earlier are actually filters that are designed to capture different distinctive features in the input data. By defining the dimension of the filter, you can control the window of infomation you want to \"summarize\". To translate back in the picture, each of the feature maps could contain 1 high level representation of the embeddings for each character.\n\n\nNext, we would apply a max pooling to get the maximum value in each feature map. In our context, some characters in each filter would be selected through this max pooling process based on their values. As usual, we would then feed into a normal densely connected layer that outputs to a softmax function which gives the probabilities of each class.\n\nNote that my explanation hides some technical details to facilitate understanding. There's a whole load of things that you could tweak with CNN. For instance, the stride size which determine how often the filter will be applied, narrow VS wide CNN, etc.\n\n**Okay! Let's see how we could implement CNN in our competition.**","outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"78ce577a41297fbcc28a5fe1bbfe11fb4c6ff193","_cell_guid":"840c804c-181d-48ea-9d78-8807ed31275e"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As always, we start off with the importing of relevant libraries and dataset:","outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8424012071cc979a496d87bb71092f7c3ff96893","_cell_guid":"d3c7bfee-5010-4382-a53f-f56aa618661f","trusted":false,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import sys, os, re, csv, codecs, numpy as np, pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\nfrom keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer\nfrom keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences\nfrom keras.layers import Dense, Input, LSTM, Embedding, Dropout, Activation, GRU,Conv1D,MaxPooling1D\nfrom keras.layers import Bidirectional, GlobalMaxPool1D,Bidirectional\nfrom keras.models import Model\nfrom keras import initializers, regularizers, constraints, optimizers, layers\nfrom keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping, ModelCheckpoint\nimport gc\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom keras.models import load_model","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"7e45751090d5dd4941e40a42e9fa73866702274c","collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"c89d10ad-6a76-40c9-9962-e30d3f7474de","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"train = pd.read_csv('../input/train.csv')\nsubmit = pd.read_csv('../input/test.csv')\nsubmit_template = pd.read_csv('../input/sample_submission.csv', header = 0)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"21b15e7df338cae34edc14d2b837b8686aca0e25","_cell_guid":"e2348981-0f8c-4596-bf3e-532ed4942c78"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Split into training and test set:","outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"e1e1e2126d9fb5498928690dfe311a88779c44a0","collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"353e95c1-31bd-453e-9593-190980b02995","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(train, train[[\"toxic\", \"severe_toxic\", \"obscene\", \"threat\", \"insult\", \"identity_hate\"]], test_size = 0.10, random_state = 42)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"428b48e98076a3341a970d1b92db736f4497df14","_cell_guid":"71741754-9135-48b2-b736-34ab6c0d0e9f"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Store the comments as seperate variables for further processing.","outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"a1301bc7c46e4caa21be39c9b2a4899cf7f41fba","collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"055dd711-beee-4e4b-b3c4-a74e8c0f81e8","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"list_sentences_train = X_train[\"comment_text\"]\nlist_sentences_test = X_test[\"comment_text\"]\nlist_sentences_submit = submit[\"comment_text\"]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"6b6a81a6858fa8a413de06a0070ab6e333c4925c","_cell_guid":"d6a1c243-3e66-4cd6-aa55-f9791f1b9892"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In our previous notebook, we have began using Kera's helpful Tokenizer class to help us do the gritty text processing work.
