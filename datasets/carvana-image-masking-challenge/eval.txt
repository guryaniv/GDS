This competition is evaluated on the mean Dice coefficient. The Dice
coefficient can be used to compare the pixel-wise agreement between a
predicted segmentation and its corresponding ground truth. The formula is
given by: 2∗|X∩Y| |X|+|Y| , where X is the predicted set of pixels and Y is
the ground truth. The Dice coefficient is defined to be 1 when both X and Y
are empty. The leaderboard score is the mean of the Dice coefficients for each
image in the test set. Submission File In order to reduce the submission file
size, our metric uses run-length encoding on the pixel values. Instead of
submitting an exhaustive list of indices for your segmentation, you will
submit pairs of values that contain a start position and a run length. E.g. '1
3' implies starting at pixel 1 and running a total of 3 pixels (1,2,3). The
competition format requires a space delimited list of pairs. For example, '1 3
10 5' implies pixels 1,2,3,10,11,12,13,14 are to be included in the mask. The
metric checks that the pairs are sorted, positive, and the decoded pixel
values are not duplicated. The pixels are numbered from top to bottom, then
left to right: 1 is pixel (1,1), 2 is pixel (2,1), etc. The file should
contain a header and have the following format: img,rle_mask 0004d4463b50_01,1
1 5 1 0004d4463b50_02,1 1 0004d4463b50_03,1 1 etc. Submission files may take
several minutes to process due to the size.
