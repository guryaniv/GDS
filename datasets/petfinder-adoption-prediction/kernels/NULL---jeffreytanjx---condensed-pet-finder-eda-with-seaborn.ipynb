The count of each Variables are plotted on the left while their breakdown by AdoptionSpeed are plotted on the right. Breed1, Breed2 and State are excluded since there are too many of them. To include them in this analysis, we may find the top 10 counts (for future follow up). \n\n#### AdoptionSpeed \n* 0 - Pet was adopted on the same day as it was listed. \n* 1 - Pet was adopted between 1 and 7 days (1st week) after being listed. \n* 2 - Pet was adopted between 8 and 30 days (1st month) after being listed. \n* 3 - Pet was adopted between 31 and 90 days (2nd & 3rd month) after being listed.\n* 4 - No adoption after 100 days of being listed. (There are no pets in this dataset that waited between 90 and 100 days).\n\n#### Findings\n* **Overall**: There is no variable that signficantly affect AdoptionSpeed as we see the distribution of the speed to be consistent among the variables.\n* **Type**: More dogs than cats. However, there are more cats than dogs in test set( [Extensive Pet Finder EDA by JasonZivkovic](http://https://www.kaggle.com/jaseziv83/extensive-pet-finder-eda)). AdoptionSpeed between both type of animals show a similar pattern. \n* **Gender**:  More female than male.  Why are some pets grouped together?  **Follow up 1**\n* **Color**: Color does not seem to affect AdoptionSpeed as we see similar AdoptionSpeed among different colors.\n* **MaturitySize**:  Mostly Medium, follow by small. Large animals is the least. Extra large pets seems to have the highest adoption rate but it may be a result of its low count. \n* **FurLength**: Animals seem well kept since most of them have short or medium furlength. Similarly, long fur length seems to have the highest adoption rate but we are unsure how accurate this observation is since there is not a lot of such pets in the dataset.\n* **Vaccinated, Dewormed and Sterilized**: Most animals are not vaccinated, not sterilized but dewormed. As such, Dewormed seem to be viewed as more important than Vaccinated and Sterilized. It will be interesting to look at the percentage of animals among these 3 variables. ***Follow up 2***. Nevertheless, it is interesting to point out that whether a pet is Sterilized does not seem to affect the AdoptionSpeed. Most pets are not sterilized (67.2%) but the adoption rate is actually the highest, as implied by the small purple section!\n* **Health**: Most pets are healthy! That's good news. There is a very tiny portion of pets in serious injury (0.23%) and these pets have high risk of not being adopted (41%).\n\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"b939fb30534ade6aa43ce1a0ead73b144a769889"},"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.set()\ng = sns.FacetGrid(data, col = \"Gender\", xlim = (0,30))\ng.map(sns.distplot,\"Age\", kde = False)\ng.fig.suptitle(\"Histogram of Age for different gender\")\ng.fig.subplots_adjust(top = 0.8) # adjust title position\n\ng2 = sns.FacetGrid(data, col = \"Type\")\ng2.map(sns.countplot,\"Gender\")\ng2.fig.suptitle(\"Count of Type by Gender\")\ng2.fig.subplots_adjust(top = 0.8) # adjust title position\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"979c26e8c00988ce79b8f1a78f1cbd8189ff4e82"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Follow up 1\nThere are animals which are grouped together, presumably one can adopt them altogether.
