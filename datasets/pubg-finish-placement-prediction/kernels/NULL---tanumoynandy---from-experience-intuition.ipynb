Note: Self inflicted damage is subtracted.\n* headshotKills - Number of enemy players killed with headshots.\n* heals - Number of healing items used.\n* Id - Player’s Id\n* killPlace - Ranking in match of number of enemy players killed.\n* killPoints - Kills-based external ranking of player. (Think of this as an Elo ranking where only kills matter.) If there is a value other than -1 in rankPoints, then any 0 in killPoints should be treated as a “None”.\n* killStreaks - Max number of enemy players killed in a short amount of time.\n* kills - Number of enemy players killed.\n* longestKill - Longest distance between player and player killed at time of death. This may be misleading, as downing a player and driving away may lead to a large longestKill stat.\n* matchDuration - Duration of match in seconds.\n* matchId - ID to identify match. There are no matches that are in both the training and testing set.\n* matchType - String identifying the game mode that the data comes from. The standard modes are “solo”, “duo”, “squad”, “solo-fpp”, “duo-fpp”, and “squad-fpp”; other modes are from events or custom matches.\n* rankPoints - Elo-like ranking of player. This ranking is inconsistent and is being deprecated in the API’s next version, so use with caution. Value of -1 takes place of “None”.\n* revives - Number of times this player revived teammates.\n* rideDistance - Total distance traveled in vehicles measured in meters.\n* roadKills - Number of kills while in a vehicle.\n* swimDistance - Total distance traveled by swimming measured in meters.\n* teamKills - Number of times this player killed a teammate.\n* vehicleDestroys - Number of vehicles destroyed.\n* walkDistance - Total distance traveled on foot measured in meters.\n* weaponsAcquired - Number of weapons picked up.\n* winPoints - Win-based external ranking of player. (Think of this as an Elo ranking where only winning matters.) If there is a value other than -1 in rankPoints, then any 0 in winPoints should be treated as a “None”.\n* groupId - ID to identify a group within a match. If the same group of players plays in different matches, they will have a different groupId each time.\n* numGroups - Number of groups we have data for in the match.\n* maxPlace - Worst placement we have data for in the match. This may not match with numGroups, as sometimes the data skips over placements.\nwinPlacePerc - The target of prediction. This is a percentile winning placement, where 1 corresponds to 1st place, and 0 corresponds to last place in the match. It is calculated off of maxPlace, not numGroups, so it is possible to have missing chunks in a match."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"ddaebab00f3d0e8fb13e980e1bffc31dde7f4926"},"cell_type":"code","source":"#load data for squad-tpp (squad) & squad-fpp\nsquad_data = train.loc[(train['matchType'] == 'squad') \n                       | (train['matchType'] == 'squad-fpp')]\nsquad_data.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"abdb794d82921097282ec8e4ffbdff35c81e0490"},"cell_type":"code","source":"#getting rid of useless info\nuseless_columns = ['Id', 'groupId', 'matchId']\nsquad_data.drop(useless_columns, inplace=True, axis=1)\nsquad_data.head()\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"c75a5ffb689340868b11e90c6c6d3b36511e2bcd"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In a squad game, let us test out the various strategies and see which one strategy or a combination of strategies give more **Chicken Dinners**\n\nwe would see if Running or covering the map by Vehicle or Swimming or a permutation & combination of these 3 lead to more Chicken Dinners "},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"99f00e7c147d465c98641a179c669407857081d1"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Case 1 : Running **\n\nRunning can be subdivided into two sub strategies\n\n1. ***Runners who play aggressively*** : Runners who roam about to kill enemies\n2. ***Runners who hide from fighting zones*** : Runners who run and hide from fights & encounters\n\n***(here runners mean squads who run on map with an average distance traversed above average)***\n\nNow, i will classify runners who play aggressively based on the damage they deal.\nI cannot justifiably classify aggressiveness based on kills because\n* Mean kill is about 0.90. +2 above average is also not considered aggressive.
