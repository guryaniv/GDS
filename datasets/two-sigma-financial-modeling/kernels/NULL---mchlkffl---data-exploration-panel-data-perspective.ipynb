        "b) on feature columns\n",
        "- Many features like fundamental_1 are clearly non stationary at least for some ids\n",
        "- Technical_x features have some sort of weird sinusoidal shape with a binary scale. For example technical_43 seems to be either 0 or -2\n",
        "- Within one feature, ids may differ greatly in terms of scale\n",
        "- zooming in on shorter time periods shows some sort of seasonality for some features (not done here). De-trending could be a good idea\n",
        "- Inconsistent time periods available across features for a given id. Note: some kernels have dealt with it by simply filling in missing values with medial or mean. Not sure if that's a good idea\n",
        "\n",
        "Many kernels related to this competition involve fitting linear regressions on all the instruments (ids) and all the timestamps (time periods). Whether the models used are simple, ridge or LASSO regressions, they would perform best under a number of assumptions, including that all id-period observations are independent and identically distributed (iid), which may not apply to this dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "One reason why id-period observations may not be iid is because of specific, unobserved id-level characteristics that a regression model trained across all id-periods in a \"pooled\" fashion would not be able to capture. The problem caused by unobserved differences (also called unobserved heterogeneity) may be avoided by training separate models for each id. \n",
        "\n",
        "But modeling ids separately would not leverage the relationships that are constant across all ids, which a model spanning all id-period observations can capture. Also some ids have very little time periods available across any features, which means they could benefit from what can be learnt using other ids. \n",
        "\n",
        "So a solution could be to ensemble id-specific regressions with panel data regressions that account for unobserved heterogeneity. An example of an ensembling-based solution could be a weighted score of two models, one that is id specific and one that spans several ids. The weight of the latter model would be high for Ids with little time periods available.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the following cells I look at the problemm from a panel data perspective, i.e. considering the availability and distribution of time periods by id. The ultimate questions is \"Is there any reason why I should restricted my regression to a subset of ids, for example because their features span a consistent number of time range or because they have data available across q consistent subset of columns?\"."

But if it's because specific time ranges are missing, that could be a problem. I am specifically worried that some ids may  have missing observations for time periods 1500-last. Volatility tends to increase at this point in time and predictions likely apply to timestamps beyond 1812 so it's important to accurately model relationships for this time period. Therefore, worth looking at the maximum time period available by id - is max timestamp mostly within 1500-1812?"
