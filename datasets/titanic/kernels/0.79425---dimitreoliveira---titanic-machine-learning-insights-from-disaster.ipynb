notebook is based on the awesome course series brought by [Dan](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker), some of the code and explanations were taken from there, if you like what you see here I highly recommend to checkout the course links:\n* [Machine Learning Explainability - Kaggle learn](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/machine-learning-explainability)\n\n### Here I'll try to put in practice some of what I learned from the course in another data set, and hopefully get more people attention to these very useful techniques of how to get more from your machine learning models.\n\n### Machine learning insights are meant to give you more information about how and what your model is doing, this way you have a better interpretability of what's is going on, explain the model and it's predictions to other people, validate and improve it.\n\n#### What we'll do:\n* Load data and do some basic data engineering.\n* Use [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) to model our data.\n* Take insights from our model.\n    * Permutation importance.\n    * Partial plots.\n    * SHAP values.\n    * Advanced use of SHAP values."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","collapsed":true,"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":false},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"###
