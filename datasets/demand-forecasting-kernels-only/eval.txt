Submissions are evaluated on SMAPE between forecasts and actual values. We
define SMAPE = 0 when the actual and predicted values are both 0. Kernel
Submissions You can only make submissions directly from Kaggle Kernels. By
adding your teammates as collaborators on a kernel, you can share and edit
code privately with them. Submission File For each id in the test set, you
must predict a probability for the sales variable. The file should contain a
header and have the following format: id,sales 0,35 1,22 2,5 etc.
