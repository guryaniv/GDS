Why?\n\n## The reason why it fails\nLet's start with a question: When will our cost function produce a small cost? Looking at the definition, we can conclude that it happens in two cases:\n* The return is positive, and the confidence value is also positive\n* The return is negative, and so is the confidence value\nThat also means that if we encounter even the smallest positive return, say, 0.0001, the model would attempt to squeeze the most of it by multiplying it with a large positive confidence. That means that **the model favors a large positive bias**.\n\n\"But what if the confidence value is close to 1, but the actual return is -0.0001? Wouldn't it deal a blow to the total cost?\" -- one might ask. This is correct, but let's take a look at the summary statistics for the returns for next 10 days:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"2bcee7f244b13f8d4eef74169d112b7c7775d22c"},"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.hist(train_df.returnsOpenNextMktres10, bins=60, range=(-0.25, 0.25))\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"03e3e35cacbd898e43db0358f776c6bfa65eb95d"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The distribution shows a smooth bell curve with a mean slightly above zero:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"bf598e412697f476cf3ab53d2802c83febed3ca3"},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"Mean returns: \", np.mean(train_df.returnsOpenNextMktres10))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"46ee155e0358b36b1e95e874e6b29e76c0e8d1ee"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"That means that the absolute value of all returns below 0 is less than the absolute value of all returns above 0. So, **the model** basically ignores the possibility of a return going below 0 and instead **leverages the difference between positive and negative returns to maximize the total score**.\n\n### What is the wrong underlying assumption?\nRecall the description of the evaluation function:\n> If you expect a stock to have a large positive return--compared to the broad market--over the next ten days, you might assign it a large, positive confidenceValue (near 1.0). If you expect a stock to have a negative return, you might assign it a large, negative confidenceValue (near -1.0). If unsure, you might assign it a value near zero.\n\nWith the previously mentioned example of encountering a future return of 0.0001 in the training set, it would be actually more correct to assign a confidence value close to 0. But the cost computed with the inverse scoring function would actually be higher than if the model goes all-in. That means that **we are not rewarding the model for being unconfident** even in cases where it is appropriate (near-zero or volatile returns).\n\n## Conclusion\n* Models using the inverted scoring function as a cost function are in danger of training to an overwhelmingly high bias;\n* Such models tend to be overconfident and over-optimistic because the scoring function favors large confidence values;\n* A better cost function should be rewarded for uncertainty when the returns have small positive or small negative values."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
