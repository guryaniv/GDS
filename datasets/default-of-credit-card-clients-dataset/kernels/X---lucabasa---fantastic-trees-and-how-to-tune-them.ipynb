Moreover, the hope is that most of the concepts can be transferred to other types of algorithms.\n\nThe goal is, by any means, get to a better performance but rather explore some pitfalls I have encountered in my limited experience. In particular, the most important part of a machine learning project (definition of the problem, data exploration and preparation, which I poorly performed in [this kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/lucabasa/credit-card-default-a-very-pedagogical-notebook/)) is not explored here. In this sense, the chosen dataset is perfect due to the number of entries and of features.\n\nThis notebook is organized as follow:\n\n* Preprocessing: eliminating features, creating new ones, preparation of training and testing sets\n* Decision Tree: basic functioning and how the key hyperparameters affect the result\n* Random Forest: how is it better than a tree and how to tune it efficiently\n* XGBoost: how it gets so much better and tuning strategies\n* Overfitting: Early stopping and learning curves.\n\n## Preprocessing\n\nWe will use the credit card default dataset since it has enough entries and it is clean enough. The goal is to predict if a client is going to default next month or not. The two target classes are imbalanced. Life is not perfect.\n\nWe will not consider features on purpose to speed up the learning of our trees. Just as a test, we will also produce all the possible interactions between the features to observe if the performance changes. We go from 17 to 153 features (and 1 target, the default)."},{"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"trusted":false,"_uuid":"53845306370b10cdc548e2e9c84e6a0334380542"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# standard\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\n\n#To create more features\nfrom itertools import combinations, product \n\n#Needed for the tree\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, classification_report\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV, StratifiedKFold\n\n#Needed for the forest\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import RandomizedSearchCV\n\n#Needed for XGBoost\nfrom xgboost import XGBClassifier\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import learning_curve\n\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore') #because we are animals","execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false,"_uuid":"edcc7a5dcfea76b3bd40c529b1adaaf2ada9b563"},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv('../input/UCI_Credit_Card.csv')\ndf.columns","execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false,"_uuid":"fc166d504239c720e95749e6e670dd5ccab69c90"},"cell_type":"code","source":"df['default.payment.next.month'].value_counts() #77.88%","execution_count":3,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"3b6c2616a1e967871a447a02bc64d6325a3227c5"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This means that our baseline model, which would simply predict 0 every time, has an accuracy of 77.88%.

It measures how mixed the sample is. \n\nThe core idea is:\n\n* You put all the data in a node, you test every possible split by splitting the dataset based on every possible value of every possible feature.\n* You pick the best split (the one reducing the impurity the most) and divide your data in two.\n* Repeat until a condition is reached (maximum number of splits, minimum number of samples per node, minimum increase in purity of the sample, no more features to split on, etc.)\n\nThis means that a DecisionTree is a **greedy and exhaustive algorithm**. Thus it does take the best decision every time, but not necessarily the best  for the final result.\n\nThe advantages are:\n\n* Easy to explain, being a white box algorithm.\n* It can learn non-linear relationships.\n* It is robust to outliers.\n\nHowever, it is easy to fall into the overfitting trap. This is why ensemble methods are used.\n\nIn sklearn it is very easy to build a tree and it gives us the opportunity to start learning about the key parameters."},{"metadata":{"trusted":false,"_uuid":"27bab250b0b57909509cff81eb22bbaa36e121c9"},"cell_type":"code","source":"tree = DecisionTreeClassifier()\ntree","execution_count":118,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"14797fe7342d41c1151313c587440e576358b351"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"According to the sklearn user guide, the good practices are:\n\n* With a large number of features, trees tend to overfit. The key is finding the right ratio features to samples.\n* Use **max_depth** = 3 and then monitor how the fitting goes by increasing the depth.\n* **min_sample_split** and **min_sample_leaf** control the number of samples at a leaf node. Small numbers will usually lead to overfitting, large numbers will prevent learning. Try min_sample_leaf = 5 and min_sample_split = 0.5-1% of the total values as initial value. A lower value is usually helpful if we have imbalanced class problems because the leaves where the minority class can be in majority are very small.\n* Balance the dataset before training, either but sampling or by balancing the weight. If the samples are weighted, using **min_weight_fraction_leaf** will ensure that leaf nodes contain at least a fraction of the overall sum.\n* Use **max_features** to control the number of features to consider while searching for the best split.

experiments.\n\nSome common practices are:\n\n* Not so deep trees, usually between 2 and 8\n* Learning rate at 0.1 or lower, the lower the more trees you will need.\n* Feel the learning first, we will see later how to do that, just keep in mind that what is coming next is very limited.\n* subsample can help make the model more robust by reducing variance, a popular value is around 0.8\n\nA popular strategy is to choose a fixed number of trees (in the order of the 1000 trees) and play around with the learning rate. \n\nAnother effective strategy is to pick a high learning rate, find the optimum

If we wanted a better accuracy, adding more data points would lead somewhere but one should evaluate how costly this process can be in relation to the improvement in performance. The random forest *stops learning* at 1000 data points, the single tree needs 3000 data points, and XGBoost keeps improving (slowly).\n\nOnce the two curves converge, adding more data points is very unlikely to help. In our case, we still have margins of improvement for XGBoost, but we don't have really a way of doing it (to be fair, we could simply reduce the size of the test, but let's assume that set is really untouchable).\n\nIf we want to check if our model is **biased**, we can look at the accuracy on the validation set: \n* DecisionTree: around 82%.\n* RandomForest: around 81%.\n* XGBoost: around 82%.\n\n(I admit this is not the best example)\n\nHow good is that? It depends, domain knowledge and error characterization will definitely help you in deciding if the model suffers from a bias problem. The main indicator is a low accuracy on the validation.\n\nTo decide if it is a low or high bias problem, we can look at the training error. A model with high bias would have a low accuracy on the training data. In that case, we can conclude that the model is not learning well enough.\n\nIf we want to analyze if there is a **variance** problem, we can look at the gap between the curves (bigger gap for bigger variance) and examine the value and the evolution of the training error. A high variance means a low generalization capability.\n\nLow performances on the training are a quick way to detect low variance since this means that the model has troubles in fitting the training data as the training sets change (this is called *underfit*).\n\nIf we have a problem with **high bias and low variance**, we need to increase the complexity of the model. We can do the following:\n\n* Training on more features.\n* Decrease the regularization.\n\nIf we are in the opposite situation (**low bias and high variance**) we would see large gaps and high training accuracy (thus our old friend: *overfitting*). In this case, one would have the following options:\n\n* Add more training entries.\n* Increase the regularization.\n* Reduce the number of features (this would definitely increase the bias).\n\n**Exercise**: look at the learning curves of the three models what can you conclude?\n\n**Exercise**: Using the model you prefer, make it underfit and overfit at the best of your patience and ability. Can you tell the difference by looking at the classification report?"},{"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"trusted":false,"_uuid":"7c2f938a969dc702a1087a5322b3c75832c5b2d7"},"cell_type":"code","source":"best_tree = DecisionTreeClassifier(class_weight=None,

Conclusions\n\nThis notebook had hopefully sparked some ideas on what one can do to achieve the best result for a specific problem. I want to stress again that your model will always be as good as the data you put into it, thus make that your absolute priority if you want to achieve good results.\n\nA couple of exercises I found useful to better understand these learning machines:\n\n** Exercise **: research what is a more appropriate metric to evaluate a classification model and re-run this notebook by using that one instead of accuracy.\n\n** Exercise**: create a custom metric for this problem and amaze your friends\n\nAny feedback will be very welcome, what is your strategy to tune a model?"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.4"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
