Brick-and-mortar grocery stores are always in a delicate dance with purchasing
and sales forecasting. Predict a little over, and grocers are stuck with
overstocked, perishable goods. Guess a little under, and popular items quickly
sell out, leaving money on the table and customers fuming. The problem becomes
more complex as retailers add new locations with unique needs, new products,
ever transitioning seasonal tastes, and unpredictable product marketing.
Corporación Favorita, a large Ecuadorian-based grocery retailer, knows this
all too well. They operate hundreds of supermarkets, with over 200,000
different products on their shelves. Corporación Favorita has challenged the
Kaggle community to build a model that more accurately forecasts product
sales. They currently rely on subjective forecasting methods with very little
data to back them up and very little automation to execute plans. They’re
excited to see how machine learning could better ensure they please customers
by having just enough of the right products at the right time.
