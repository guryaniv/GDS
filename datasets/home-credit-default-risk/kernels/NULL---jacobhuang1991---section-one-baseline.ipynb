In most cases, it is reliable to evaluate with complete credit records and files, however, some people do not have those records. So, it is hard to know if they will pay for the bill in the future. \n\nIn this project, we will use the historical loan application data provided by Home Credit to predict whether or not an applicant will be able to repay a loan. We first build a baseline model using simple data preprocessing and logistic regression model in section one. After that, in the second section, we add new datasets and take various feature engineering strategies to improve accuracy. In addition, we apply a brand new machine learning model - light GBM (Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) implementation with GOSS and EFB), which is very effective and efficient for large size data. The result shows that our methods are effective. In the third section, we select the best features based on the results of the previous two sections. We remove the collinear, missing, and unimportant features. The result shows that the feature selection methods are effective.

So, it is necessary to build an automatical system to evaluate the credit of people. A lot of related studies have been done in recent years.\n\nKhandani, A. E., Kim, A. J., & Lo, A. W. [1] applied machine learning models to forecast the consumer credit risk. They collected the customer transactions and credit bureau data from 2005 to 2009. They constructed out-of-sample forecasts that significantly improve the classification rates of credit-card-holder delinquencies and defaults, with linear regression R2’s of forecasted/realized delinquencies of 85%. \n\nGalindo, J., and Tamayo, P.[2] introduced a specific modeling methodology based on the study of error curves. The results show that CART decision-tree models provide the best estimation for default with an average 8.31% error rate for a training sample of 2,000 records. \n\nIn addition, Neural Networks provided the second best results with an average error of 11.00%. The K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm had an average error rate of 14.95%. These results outperformed the standard Probit algorithm which attained an average error rate of 15.13%. \n\nOne challenge for their study is the data size. If there is more data for training the model, the accuracy would be higher according to the experience.

Due to insufficient or even no credit histories for those people, we can only utilize other records to evaluate their credibility. Home Credit is a company to take advantage of various data, like transactional information, to predict the reliability of those people, especially for their repayment abilities.\n\nIn this project, we will use the historical loan application data provided by Home Credit to predict whether or not an applicant will be able to repay a loan. The data size is very large, so it is not a good idea to use traditional machine learning models. Instead, we use Light GBM as the classifier [3]. \n\nLight GBM is a quick, distributed, efficient gradient boosting framework based on the decision tree algorithm. It splits the tree leaf wise with the best fit whereas other boosting algorithms split the tree depth wise or level wise rather than leaf-wise. So, when growing on the same leaf in Light GBM, the leaf-wise algorithm can reduce more loss than the level-wise algorithm and hence results in much better accuracy which can rarely be achieved by any of the existing boosting algorithms.\n\nLeaf wise splits lead to increase in complexity and may lead to overfitting and it can be overcome by specifying another parameter max-depth which specifies the depth to which splitting will occur. However, Light GBM is sensitive to overfitting and can easily overfit small data. So, it is only suitable for large data. \n![](https://i.postimg.cc/XqY0Jffr/leaf.png)\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/DwX38yXP/depth.png)"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"2ea4574dc66ae52dcdad146b63f91d03289f568d"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In addition the Light GBM, we use several methods to make feature engineering and feature selection to improve the accuracy and efficiency.
