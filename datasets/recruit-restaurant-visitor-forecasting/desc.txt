Running a thriving local restaurant isn't always as charming as first
impressions appear. There are often all sorts of unexpected troubles popping
up that could hurt business. One common predicament is that restaurants need
to know how many customers to expect each day to effectively purchase
ingredients and schedule staff members. This forecast isn't easy to make
because many unpredictable factors affect restaurant attendance, like weather
and local competition. It's even harder for newer restaurants with little
historical data. Recruit Holdings has unique access to key datasets that could
make automated future customer prediction possible. Specifically, Recruit
Holdings owns Hot Pepper Gourmet (a restaurant review service), AirREGI (a
restaurant point of sales service), and Restaurant Board (reservation log
management software). In this competition, you're challenged to use
reservation and visitation data to predict the total number of visitors to a
restaurant for future dates. This information will help restaurants be much
more efficient and allow them to focus on creating an enjoyable dining
experience for their customers.
