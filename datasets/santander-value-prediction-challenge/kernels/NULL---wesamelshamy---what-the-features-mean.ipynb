Even though in practice this information is usually available to in-house modellers, hiding it this way gives this problem a numerology flavor.  Nevertheless, we will make reasonable assumptions as to what the features and their order means.\n\nThis is Santander's third Kaggle competition.  One of their two earlier competitions had a dataset [with meaningful column names][3].  However, the features had different types and ranges compared to what we have in this competition.  So it may not help us decipher our features.\n\nIn this analysis, I will go beyond exploring the data and will try to understand what the features represent.\n\n[1]: https://www.santander.com/csgs/Satellite/CFWCSancomQP01/es_ES/Corporativo.html?leng=en_GB\n[2]: http://banksdaily.com/topbanks/Europe/market-cap-2017.html\n[3]: https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-product-recommendation/data"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"1a9a02a1dff9e9c8ee7f03b52c8b7833c23768c8"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 4,990 Features\nThe dataset is made of one traning (`train.csv`) and one test (`test.csv`) files.
