This pool is based on the ones-digit of the final score similar to the standard super bowl pool. There is a 10 x 10 grid where the winning team is one axis and the losing team is other axis. The one's digit of the final score is used to determine the winner. For example, if the final score is 74-68 and you own the box that is Winning Team 4 - Losing Team 8, then you are the winner for that game. There are winners for every game of the tournament. I wanted to see what the trends are and what boxes are the most valuable based on patterns in final scores historically."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n\nimport os\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.\n","execution_count":11,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":false},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Regular Season Data\n\nFirst let's take a look at the patterns we see in the regular season data since this has the most games and it will be the best indicator of any trends:"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true,"_uuid":"1992be02fcac17e3b570b80f7d631b87e16337da"},"cell_type":"code","source":"reg_df = pd.read_csv('../input/RegularSeasonCompactResults.csv')\nprint('There are %s games in this dataset' % reg_df.shape[0])","execution_count":26,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"ee0eb506521751cd56a33045186442875c773c3c"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"So this data set has over 150 thousand games which is a decent sized dataset.
