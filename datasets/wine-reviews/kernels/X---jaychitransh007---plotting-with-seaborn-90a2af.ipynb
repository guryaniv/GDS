Each individual row is a single record (a review); in aggregate, the list of all rows is the list of all records (all reviews). This is the format of choice for the most kinds of data: data corresponding with individual, unit-identifiable \"things\" (\"records\"). The majority of the simple data that gets generated is created in this format, and data that isn't can almost always be converted over. This is known as a \"tidy data\" format.\n\n`seaborn` is designed to work with this kind of data out-of-the-box, for all of its plot types, with minimal fuss. This makes it an incredibly convenient workbench tool.\n\n`pandas` is not designed this way. In `pandas`, every plot we generate is tied very directly to the input data. In essence, `pandas` expects your data being in exactly the right *output* shape, regardless of what the input is.\n\n<!--\nIn the previous section of this tutorial, we purposely evaded this issue by using supplemental datasets in a \"just right\" shape. Starting from the data that we already have, here's what it would take to generate a simple histogram:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\ntop_five_wines_scores = (\n    reviews\n        .loc[np.where(reviews.variety.isin(reviews.variety.value_counts().head(5).index))]\n        .loc[:, ['variety', 'points']]\n        .groupby('variety')\n        .apply(lambda df: pd.Series(df.points.values))\n        .unstack()\n        .T\n)\ntop_five_wines_scores.plot.hist()\n```\n\nAs we demonstrated above, to do the same thing in `seaborn`, all we need is:\n\n```python\nsns.distplot(reviews.points, bins=10, kde=False)\n```\n\nThe difference is stark!\n-->\n\nHence, in practice, despite its simplicity, the `pandas` plotting tools are great for the initial stages of exploratory data analytics, but `seaborn` really becomes your tool of choice once you start doing more sophisticated explorations.\n\n<!--\nMy recommendations are:\n* Bar plot: \n  * `pd.Series.plot.bar`\n  * `sns.countplot`\n* Scatter plot:\n  * `pd.Series.plot.scatter`\n  * `sns.jointplot`\n* Hex plot:\n  * `pd.Series.plot.hex`\n  * `sns.jointplot`\n* Line/KDE plot:\n  * `pd.Series.plot.line` for nominal categorical variables\n  * `sns.kdeplot` for interval variables\n* Box/Violin plot:\n  * `sns.boxplot`\n  * `sns.violinplot`\n* Histogram:\n   * `sns.distplot`\n-->"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"7e175119-20cd-49b3-8119-fe09d4771c36","_uuid":"e9372bfddfbed428c0faaa3dc5786514a67f335f"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Examples\n\nAs in previous notebooks, let's now test ourselves by answering some questions about the plots we've used in this section.
