I will flag up some of the many gotchas in this type of simulation. The strategy is attributed to Richard Dennis and his team of \"turtle\" traders, check out the book \"Way of the Turtle\" for more details.\n\nNote I would strongly recommend that you not actually trade this, this is purely a simple example to highlight various tricks and pitfalls with the data. This kernel does not consitute trading or financial advice in anyway. Bitcoin is a particularly volatile market with some unique challenges and not the place to start in my limited opinion if you are interested in algorithmic trading.\n\nThis is a work in progress, please comment if you'd like to see more and I will extend it for the execution simulation"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"495a80b5-8c7e-3ea5-dc76-898938d0a50f","_uuid":"bdc76654c543e014addc9ca3bf8d86416b88d501","_active":true,"_execution_state":"idle","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"\nimport numpy as np \nimport pandas as pd \nimport datetime\nimport os\n\n#define a conversion function for the native timestamps in the csv file\ndef dateparse (time_in_secs):    \n    return datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(float(time_in_secs))\n\nprint('Data listing...')\nprint(os.listdir('../input/'))\n\n# read in the data and apply our conversion function, this spits out a DataFrame with the DateTimeIndex already in place\nprint('Using bitstampUSD_1-min_data_2012-01-01_to_2018-01-08.csv...')\ndata = pd.read_csv('../input/bitstampUSD_1-min_data_2012-01-01_to_2018-01-08.csv', parse_dates=True, date_parser=dateparse, index_col=[0])\n\nprint('Total null open prices: %s' % data['Open'].isnull().sum())","execution_count":4,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"f4ee0b09f4aae0f0cb1bd55056c5f52be6838cf6","_active":false,"_cell_guid":"79ea009d-9858-7170-047c-3f1c34203f4b","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# First thing is to fix the data for bars/candles where there are no trades. \n# Volume/trades are a single event so fill na's with zeroes for relevant fields...\ndata['Volume_(BTC)'].fillna(value=0, inplace=True)\ndata['Volume_(Currency)'].fillna(value=0, inplace=True)\ndata['Weighted_Price'].fillna(value=0, inplace=True)\n\n# next we need to fix the OHLC (open high low close) data which is a continuous timeseries so\n# lets fill forwards those values...\ndata['Open'].fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)\ndata['High'].fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)\ndata['Low'].fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)\ndata['Close'].fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)\n\n# check how we are looking now, should be nice and clean...\nprint(data)","execution_count":8,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"b8ed6ab4f9f4379a0642fbf9f6c3eb012540de24","_active":false,"_cell_guid":"58e48fd8-1489-6f0e-f2dd-ba8d0272f98b","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# The first thing we need are our trading signals.
