Submissions are evaluated according to the Mean Average Precision @ 3 (MAP@3):
MAP@3= 1 U U ∑ u=1 min(n,3) ∑ k=1 P(k) where U is the number of scored
drawings in the test data, P(k) is the precision at cutoff k, and n is the
number predictions per drawing. You can learn more about this metric works
from this kernel, and from this python code. Kernel Submissions You can make
submissions directly from Kaggle Kernels. By adding your teammates as
collaborators on a kernel, you can share and edit code privately with them.
Submission File For each key_id in the test set, you should predict up to 3
word values. The file should contain a header and have the following format.
IMPORTANT: Some "words" are actually more than one word! The training data
aligns to the Quick Draw dataset that that was previously released, and uses
spaces to delimit multi-word labels. The Kaggle metric for this competition
requires labels with no spaces, so you will need to adjust your label
predictions to replace spaces with underscores. For example, "roller coaster"
should be predicted as "roller_coaster". key_id,word
