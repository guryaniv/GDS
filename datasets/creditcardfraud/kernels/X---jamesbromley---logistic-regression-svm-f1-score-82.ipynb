This is why you will see me doing things like manually calculating precision and recall. For this reason, I won't apologise for excessive use of print statements either. ;-)\n\nMy introduction to machine learning has been through Andrew Ng's excellent course on coursera.org.

The majority of the work in this notebook covers some of the techniques and nuances that I have learned in this course.\n\nThere are many more advanced learning methods out there which are now very popular on Kaggle, such as various forms of Gradient Boosting, but the choice of ML algorithm is not the only important factor.

A hyperplane is a subspace whose dimension is one less than that of its ambient space. So if we have:\n\n* Data in two dimensions, it will be separated by a line.\n* Data in three dimensions, the data will be separated by a two dimensional plane.\n* Etc.\n\nThe key thing to note is that, at it's heart an SVM is essentially a linear classifier. To generate more complex, non-linear classifiers, we can use various kernel functions. I won't go into the details, but the number of new features generated scales with the number of training examples. This can be problematic with very large training sets. With our relatively small training set size, this particular problem lends itself well to the use of SVMs.\n\nThese are the kernels we will test:\n\n* Linear (i.e. no kernel, just a basic SVM).\n* Radial Basis Functions (RBF) - This is a form of the Gaussian function.\n\nAlthough other kernels exist and we can even write our own kernels, these are the two most popular kernels. The RBF is capable of generating some very complex decision boundaries and should make an interesting comparison to the linear kernel.\n\nIt is very important to carry out feture scaling before using SVM's. Fortunately, our features are already scaled.\n\n## 2.1 - Trying the linear classifier\nScikit-learn has an inbuilt SVM classifier called SVC. This uses the RBF kernel by default. Although this has the option to use a linear kernel, there is also the option to use LinearSVC classifier. As far as I can tell these function similarly, but according to the documentation the LinearSVC is implemented slightly differently. This makes it less restrictive in the choice of penalties and loss functions. It should scale better to large numbers of samples, but that is not a concern as our training set is quite small.\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"d56c75875ccd3ebcef7a3174f503237339712746"},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.svm import SVC, LinearSVC #import both the Linear and SVM classifier\n\nsvm_lin = LinearSVC(C=1.0) # C is effectively a regularisation parameter, we will experiement with changing this later\n\nsvm_lin.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\nprint(\"Training set linear classifier score: %.2f%%\" % (100 * svm_lin.score(X_train, y_train)))\nprint(\"Cross-validation set linear classifier score: %.2f%%\" % (100 * svm_lin.score(X_cv, y_cv)))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"e8aaa55e20405ea52c52da0387c9f2e8a1f3f655"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Similar to the logistic regression, we got a higher score on the cross training data.
