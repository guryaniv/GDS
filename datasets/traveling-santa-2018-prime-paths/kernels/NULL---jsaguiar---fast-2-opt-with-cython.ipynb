It's considered a tour improvement heuristic, since we need a initial solution (tour).\n\nIn this notebook I will compare the 2-opt heuristic in Python and Cython. I'm using [this presentation](http://on-demand.gputechconf.com/gtc/2014/presentations/S4534-high-speed-2-opt-tsp-solver.pdf) as reference for the 2-opt algorithm."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"67c7b358b64ff10829fa0da25a87fb5df8363401"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h3>Prepare inputs</h3>\n\nTo test the speed I'll use only the first 5,000 cities.

Since this problem have symmetric distances, the only change in the tour length is between these four cities. The path between i+1 and j will be reversed, but the distance from node A to B is the same from B to A, so the path length wont change.\n\nWe also need the *best pair of edges*, so the algorithm must loop trough all possible combinations of i and j before making the move (update tour). This is a naive approach and more complex heuristics can select a few nodes to try instead of every single combination.\n\nIt's important to calculate distances fast, so I timed a few different functions (math.sqrt, np.linalg, scipy) and the fastest was using np.hypot. The best option would be a pre-computed distance matrix between all cities, but I think we have too many cities for that."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"28f08d2456747736ebf18ad1b6401e423c099b37"},"cell_type":"code","source":"def two_opt_python():\n    min_change = 0\n    num_cities = len(tour)\n    # Find the best move\n    for i in range(num_cities - 2):\n        for j in range(i + 2, num_cities - 1):\n            change = dist(i, j) + dist(i+1, j+1) - dist(i, i+1) - dist(j, j+1)\n            if change < min_change:\n                min_change = change\n                min_i, min_j = i, j\n    # Update tour with best move\n    if min_change < 0:\n        tour[min_i+1:min_j+1] = tour[min_i+1:min_j+1][::-1]        \n\ndef dist(a, b):\n    \"\"\"Return the euclidean distance between cities tour[a] and tour[b].\"\"\"\n    return np.hypot(coords[tour[a], 0] - coords[tour[b], 0],\n                    coords[tour[a], 1] - coords[tour[b], 1])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"e62a114455427f4504bc0f53905c6a76599ffcc8"},"cell_type":"code","source":"%time two_opt_python()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"5ada62c57939305d0b9a576c084f9cdca7c16102"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We should run two_opt_python function until there are no more improvements (min_change >= 0), but as we can see this is extremelly slow even for a single iteration with a small sample..."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"9fef52e81b688966dfa923c627199b58bee164c7"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h3>Now with Cython...</h3>\n\nWith Cython we can implement C functions with a python syntax:\n\n> Cython is an optimising static compiler for both the Python programming language and the extended Cython programming language.
