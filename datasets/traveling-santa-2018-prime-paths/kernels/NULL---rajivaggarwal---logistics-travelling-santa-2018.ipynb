Many of these assumptions are things we would need to consider in Logistics.\n\n* Santa only delivers at night.  This means he cannot travel to arbitrary locations.  Instead he needs to visit a time zone when it is night and avoid timezones when it is daylight.\n * We can model this by dividing the delivery area into 24 \"wedges\".  Think of each wedge being an area that Santa needs to complete all deliveries within 1 hour.\n * With Logisitics we may want to accomplish all deliveries at the same time.  Thus we may assign each \"wedge\" to a different delivery person so that they can be done in parallel.\n* Santa probably can't carry all presents in his bag/sleigh.  Yes, he is magical but he may need to return to the North Pole to get more presents.\n * With this assumption, we'll center the \"wedges\" around the North Pole and we'll make each \"wedge\" a roundtrip where he goes out and back.\n * With Logistics we'd want a \"Hub\" where all the delivery people start from.  Thus the aligns well with \"wedges\" around the North Pole (Hub).\n \nFor simplicity, let's assume that each citiy receives the same number of presents.

But we have some benefits:\n\n* Our route contains round trips to the \"hub\" so we can get more gifts or have elfs do some of the timezones/wedges\n* Our route is broken up into evenly sized distributions (by city count)\n* Our route has a predictable path\n   * This is important in Logistics where we'd want to load packages in a \"first in, last out\" order\n      * Imagine the label for a gift being printed at the fulfillment center.  This is 1 or 2 days before delivery.  At that time we can print the \"wedge\" and \"band\" on the label.  This information can then be used to sort the package in \"first in, last out\" order into the delivery truck.  The alternative, which is also popular, is to relabel the package at the delivery \"hub\".\n \n#### Further Considerations and Improvements\n\nThere is still more to consider and improve!\n\n* Could we use a variable band width inside a wedge?\n* We balance the wedges by cities (with assumption that each city has the same number of stops and gifts), but we should also balance by distance and time\n   * For Logistics we'd want to assign the same amount of \"work\" to each delivery person\n      * Equal \"work\" is a balance of city density, time, distance, gifts and addresses per stop"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
