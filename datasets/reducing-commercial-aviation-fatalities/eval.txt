Submissions are evaluated on the Multi Class Log Loss between the predicted
probabilities and the observed target. The submitted probabilities are not
required to sum to one because they are rescaled prior to being scored (each
row is divided by the row sum). In order to avoid the extremes of the log
function, predicted probabilities are replaced with max(min(p,1− 10 −15 ), 10
−15 ) m . Submission File For each id in the test set, you must predict a
probability for each of the 4 possible cognitive states ( A = baseline / no
event, B = SS, C = CA, D = DA). The file must have a header and should look
like the following: id,A,B,C,D 0,1,0,0,0 1,1,0,0,0 2,1,0,0,0 etc.
