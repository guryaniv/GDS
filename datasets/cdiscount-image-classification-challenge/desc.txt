Cdiscount.com generated nearly 3 billion euros last year, making it Franceâ€™s
largest non-food e-commerce company. While the company already sells
everything from TVs to trampolines, the list of products is still rapidly
growing. By the end of this year, Cdiscount.com will have over 30 million
products up for sale. This is up from 10 million products only 2 years ago.
Ensuring that so many products are well classified is a challenging task.
Currently, Cdiscount.com applies machine learning algorithms to the text
description of the products in order to automatically predict their category.
As these methods now seem close to their maximum potential, Cdiscount.com
believes that the next quantitative improvement will be driven by the
application of data science techniques to images. In this challenge you will
be building a model that automatically classifies the products based on their
images. As a quick tour of Cdiscount.com's website can confirm, one product
can have one or several images. The data set Cdiscount.com is making available
is unique and characterized by superlative numbers in several ways: Almost 9
million products: half of the current catalogue More than 15 million images at
180x180 resolution More than 5000 categories: yes this is quite an extreme
multi-class classification!
