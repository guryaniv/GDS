This work is loosely bases on a [survey produced by Chandola et al `(`2009`)`](https://www.vs.inf.ethz.ch/edu/HS2011/CPS/papers/chandola09_anomaly-detection-survey.pdf), but it does not intend to cover all the techniques approached in their studies. We will begin describing what is an anomaly and what are its types, following with the challenges imposed by the mains characteristics of the anomaly detection problem.\nThen, we will describe the nature of the dataset used in this work.\n\nAlthough the dataset here considerer is specific to one kind of anomaly detection application, namely, fraud detection, we will treat it as if it was more general, not limiting ourself to the techniques recommended for the dataset we have. Our intention is to provide a practical survey of how some of the main anomaly detection techniques could be implemented, even if they are not tailored for fraud detection. Nonetheless, we will discuss when some method should be preferred, and in the process, justify why some methods yield better results than other in our particular case.\n\n## What is an anomaly\n\"Anomalies are patterns in data that do not conform to a well defined notion of normal behavior\" `(`Chandola et al, 2009`)`. In other words, we can think of them as data coming from another generating process than the one most observations came from. For example, in the image bellow, taken from the survey, we can see the points \\( o_1 \\) and \\(o_2 \\) `(`the \\( O \\) is for outliers`)` isolated from the others. This is a very strong cue that they are anomalies in this two dimensional \n\n![Image](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vipin_Kumar26/publication/220565847/figure/fig1/AS:340388092104705@1458166253261/Fig-1-A-simple-example-of-anomalies-in-a-2-dimensional-data-set.png)\n\nMoreover, points in region \\( O_3 \\) are also anomalies. Even though they fall in a neighborhood of data, all points in that neighborhood are also anomalies, thus coming from another distribution than those marked with \\( N_1 \\) and \\( N_2 \\), where the normal data lies. Anomalies may arise for many reasons. Some examples are credit card frauds, malfunctioning machines or sensors, government corruption, economic crises or sintoms from diseases.\n\nThere are three types of anomalies. The first one is point anomaly, that is, \"an individual data instance can be considered as anomalous with respect to the rest of data\" `(`idem`)`. In the image above, instance \\( o_1 \\) and \\( o_2 \\) and all instances in \\( O_3 \\) are point anomalies since they lie outside the normal regions. As another example, consider credit card transaction data, with information only about amount spent. Then, a transaction to hight compared to the rest for a particular individual is an anomaly.\n\nThe second type of anomaly is contextual. In this case, the data must have features regarding some contextual attribute `(`e.g. time, space`)` and some features regarding behavioral attributes. The anomaly is than determined withing a given context. As an example, consider again credit card transactions, but now we have both information about the amount spend and day of the year. Now, a hight amount transaction might be considered normal if it occurred in the week before Christmas, but the same amount transaction in July might be suspicious. We could also have information about the location the client is when performing transactions, and than expect hight amounts if we detect he/she is somewhere far from home, as in a vacation.\n\nThe final type of anomaly is collective. In this case, some related data instances are anomalous with respect to the entire data set, but each individual instances may not be considered anomalous. As an example, consider the stock of a retailer. We expect to see its volume fluctuating in time, with low values followed by hight values. However, a low stock for a long period of time is a anomaly. Note that the low volume per se is not an anomaly, but it persistence is. \n\nNote that the last two types assume some relation among data instances, that is, they are not independent identically distributed `(`i.i.d`)`. In the present work, we have credit card transaction information and time is one of the features, so we could treat this problem as contextual anomaly detection. However, we only have tow days of data, making int almost impossible to determine a useful temporal context. Hence, we will only consider point anomalies techniques to avoid the burden in the extra work of defining a context. Nonetheless, we will keep time as a feature, so in some sense the contextual information will be considered, although no directly modeled.\n\nOne final consideration that we need to make is that here only semi-supervised approaches to machine learning will be considered. The other possibility would be to simply use supervised classification methods with some data processing. Since our purpose it to make a anomaly detection survey and not a machine learning clarification survey, we will ignore these techniques. Instead, we refer to the Kaggle website, where most notebooks within the data here consider uses classification supervised approaches for solving the anomaly detection problem. Fore those interesting in supervised anomaly detection,  we recommend a particularly good notebook made by the user joparga3: [In depth skewed data classification](https://www.kaggle.com/joparga3/d/dalpozz/creditcardfraud/in-depth-skewed-data-classif-93-recall-acc-now). We will also use his results as a benchmark `(`and a little bit of his code`)`.\n\n## Challenges\n\nOne straightforward approach to anomaly detection would be to simply define a region were the normal data lies and classify anything out of that region as an anomaly. This is most easily said than done and there are some major challenges that often arise in anomaly detection problem:\n\n    - Modeling a normal region that captures all normal behavior is extremely difficult and the boundary between normal an abnormal is often blurred.\n    \n    - Anomalies might be the result of malicious actions. Than, the malicious adversaries are always trying to adapt to make anomalous observations seem normal.\n    \n    - The normal behavior can change, and then a current notion of normal might not be valid in the future.\n    \n    - As we've seen, the notion of an anomaly varies for different application domains, and there is no algorithm that can handle all of them equally well.\n    \n    - Labeled data for training/validation of models used by anomaly detection techniques is usually a major issue, being either extremely scarce or non existent.\n    \n    - If the data contains a lot of noise, it is difficult to distinguish noisy instances from anomalies."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"21a9692b-5e14-1555-5930-831be4b14647","_uuid":"7e7285485135f6dc3806296133b608a3128dd3eb","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd # for data analytics\nimport numpy as np # for numerical computation\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt, style # for ploting\nimport seaborn as sns # for ploting\nfrom sklearn.metrics import fbeta_score, precision_score, recall_score, confusion_matrix # for evaluation\nimport itertools\n\nstyle.use('ggplot')\nnp.random.seed(42) \n\ndef plot_confusion_matrix(cm, classes,\n                          normalize=False,\n                          title='Confusion matrix',\n                          cmap=plt.cm.Blues):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints and plots the confusion matrix.\n    Normalization can be applied by setting `normalize=True`.\n    Copyed from a kernel by joparga3 https://www.kaggle.com/joparga3/kernels\n    \"\"\"\n    plt.figure()\n    plt.imshow(cm, interpolation='nearest', cmap=cmap)\n    plt.title(title)\n    plt.colorbar()\n    tick_marks = np.arange(len(classes))\n    plt.xticks(tick_marks, classes, rotation=0)\n    plt.yticks(tick_marks, classes)\n\n    thresh = cm.max() / 2.\n    for i, j in itertools.product(range(cm.shape[0]), range(cm.shape[1])):\n        plt.text(j, i, cm[i, j],\n                 horizontalalignment=\"center\",\n                 color=\"white\" if cm[i, j] > thresh else \"black\")\n\n    plt.tight_layout()\n    plt.ylabel('True label')\n    plt.xlabel('Predicted label')\n    plt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"165b4f01-7169-26f9-5e29-fc1ac2f77680","_uuid":"d1b3c6830f32b8d8a227c23b719f7a6a2f4125c4"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Dataset\n\nWe will use the “Credit Card Fraud Detection”. Following the description provided, \"the datasets contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class `(`frauds`)` account for 0.172% of all transactions.\n\nIt contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Features V1, V2, ... V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount, this feature can be used for example-dependant cost-senstive learning. Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.\"\n\nAs said before, we will consider semi-supervised techiques, were we assume that the training data has labeled instances for only the normal class. In this case, we typically build a model to capture only the normal behavior, tune the model complexity in a labeled validation set and evaluate the model in a equally labeled testing set. More formally, during training, we only model \\( P(x) \\), that is, the probability of the normal data. At test time, we classify as an anomaly instances that have very low probability. Even when such probability is not directly available in the model, we can, most of the time define a score function proportional to it. Using a validation set, we can tune a threshold for the probability or score below which we will classify the instance as an anomaly. \n\nFor more detailed explanation about the semi-supervised approach, please refer to Andrew Ng's [playlist about anomaly detection](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnnr1O8OWc6b_KudrHI0Vcf6sEu6xs9Ky).\n\nSince some of the techniques considered works `(`much`)` better if the features are all Gaussian, we will transform the `Amount` and `Time` features to make them more Gaussian like. Our approach will be to simply take the \\( log \\) transformation of them. Since some features have zeros, we first add one to \\( log \\) of zero. \n"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"26982498-d130-d511-df6b-e2427f55afef","_uuid":"f5519879ccc3d8195753bc6551da38be4a4ffa76","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"dataset = pd.read_csv('../input/creditcard.csv')#.drop('Time', axis=1)\n\ndataset['Amount'] = np.log(dataset['Amount'] + 1)\ndataset['Time'] = np.log(dataset['Time'] + 1)\nnormal = dataset[dataset['Class'] == 0]\n\nanomaly = dataset[dataset['Class'] == 1]\nprint(normal.shape)\nprint(anomaly.shape)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"c94a3129-65ae-f3b4-a93d-8ae535db8bba","_uuid":"13358d888144acaf100a31a22445700892844df6"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"To split the data, we will hold 50% of the **normal** instances for training.

We will thus use precision and recall metrics. As in Sklearn documentations:\n\n\"A system with high recall but low precision returns many results, but most of its predicted labels are incorrect when compared to the training labels. A system with high precision but low recall is just the opposite, returning very few results, but most of its predicted labels are correct when compared to the training labels. An ideal system with high precision and high recall will return many results, with all results labeled correctly.\n\nPrecision ( \\( P\\) ) is defined as the number of true positives ( \\( T_p\\) ) over the number of true positives plus the number of false positives (\\( F_p\\)):\n\n$$P = \\frac{T_p}{T_p + F_p}$$\n\nRecall (\\( R \\)) is defined as the number of true positives (\\( T_p \\)) over the number of true positives plus the number of false negatives (\\( F_n \\)):\n\n$$R = \\frac{T_p}{T_p + F_n}$$\n\nThese quantities are also related to the (\\( F_1 \\)) score.\"\n\nSince we are in a scenario of credit card fraud detection, failing to detect a fraud has a higher cost than assigning as fraudulent a normal transaction. Hence, we are more concerned with a high recall metric, as this shows that our system can consistently detect frauds, even if this means getting a few false positives. Nonetheless, we don't want to have a lot of false positives, since there is also a cost in verifying to much transactions assigned as frauds. \n\nSo we can summarize our model's performance in a single metric, we will use the `(`\\( F_2 \\)`)` score, which places more importance in recall than precision. Formally, it is defined as\n\n$$F_2 = (1+2^2) \\frac{P * R}{2^2 * P + R}$$\n\nWe will also report confusion matrix for a better understanding of how our errors are distributed.\n\n## Benchmarks\n\nAs  a benchmark, we will use joparga3’s notebook. In one of his experiment. As in the time of this writing, the final result was 85284 true negatives, 91 true positives, 56 false negatives and 12 false positives. This results in the following metrics:\n\n$$P = 0.883$$\n$$R = 0.619$$\n$$F_2 = 0.658$$\n\n## Statistical Anomaly Detection Techniques\n\nAs cited in Chandola et al, \"an anomaly is an observation which is suspected of being partially or wholly irrelevant because it is not generated by the stochastic model assumed” `(`Anscombe and Guttman 1960`)`. Hence, we assume that *Normal data instances occur in high probability regions of a stochastic model, while anomalies occur in the low probability regions of the stochastic model.* In the statistical model techniques we fit a statistical model and perform statistical inference to decide if an unseen observation comes from the model distribution or not. One advantage of this methods is that we can associate a confidence interval to each prediction, which can help when deciding on a course of action to deal with the anomalies. Another advantages is that if the model is robust to anomalies, it can be used in an unsupervised fashion, without needing any labeled data.\n\nHere we will consider only two statistical anomaly detection techniques.\n\n### Gaussian Model Based\n\nIn this technique, we assume that the data comes from a Gaussian distribution. We can fit such a Gaussian using simple *Maximum Likelihood Estimates* `(`MLE`)`. Then, the distance from the mean in standard deviations is the anomaly score for an data instance:\n\n$$\\pmb{z}=\\frac{|\\pmb{x}-\\pmb{\\bar{x}}|}{\\pmb{s}}$$\n\nWhere \\( \\pmb{\\bar{x}} \\) is the sample mean and \\( \\pmb{s} \\) is the sample variance. We can use a validation set to find an optimal threshold for the score, above which we will consider the instance an anomaly. This is equivalent to finding a hypersphere where the center is the sample mean and the radius is determined by the threshold. Data points outside this sphere will be classified as anomalous. One drawback of this technique is that it does not account for relationships among variables. More technically, this model assumes that that each feature in the data is linear independent from one another and that probabilities of the data can be decomposed as follows\n\n$$P(\\pmb{X})=P(\\pmb{x_1})*P(\\pmb{x_2})*...*P(\\pmb{x_d})$$\n\nThis would not be a problem if all our variables where principal components extracted from PCA, since they would be linear independent, but as this is not the case, we better account for correlation among features. To do that, we simply use the use the Mahalanobis distance of a test instance \\( \\pmb{x} \\) to the sample mean \\( \\pmb{\\bar{x}} \\). So that this score reflects a valid probability distribution, we will fit a full covariance matrix multi-variate normal distribution to the data:\n\n$$\\widehat{P(\\pmb{x})}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(2 \\pi)^d * det \\pmb{S}^{-1}}} * exp \\Big(-\\frac{1}{2}*(\\pmb{x}-\\pmb{\\bar{x}})^T\\pmb{S}^{-1}(\\pmb{x}-\\pmb{\\bar{x}})\\Big)$$\n\nwere \\( \\pmb{S} \\) is the sample covariance matrix. This fix the problem of assuming linear independence.

First, it is vary fast and scales well to large amounts of data; second, we don't need to tune any hyper-parameters, only the threshold; third, this technique is extremely effective even if the data is only close to Gaussian and it also captures well the relations between variables; fifth, if the distributions is robust to outliers, we can use this technique in an fully unsupervised way, without the need of labeled data; lastly, we have direct access to the probability that the data came from a normal distribution and we can also place a confidence interval around this predictions.\n\nHowever, there is certainly some disadvantages in using this method. The most obvious one is that the data need not to come from a Gaussian distribution. One possibility is that the data comes from a mixture of Gaussian distribution or even by a completely different distribution. As we will see, it is actually the case that some of our features have distributions that can't be captured by this Gaussian model.\n\n### Histogram Based\n\nThe model seen above is a parametric one in the sense the we only estimate the parameters of the multivariate distribution, namely the mean and covariance matrix. Another option is to use a non-parametric statistical technique. Here, we consider using histograms to model the normal data profile. Bellow, we see 5 histograms for different features in our data, both for normal and anomalous instances.

Furthermore  in the histogram for `Amount` we can see that even after we used the logarithmic transformation, it does not look very Gaussian. The distribution for normal and abnormal data have a large overlapping area, so we can't hope to use it alone to identify fraudulent transactions. The histograms for feature `V10` show better behaved distributions; for the abnormal data, we can see that is follows something close to a mixture of Gaussian, while the normal data follows a clear normal distribution. Lastly, although there is some overlap between the normal and abnormal data distribution, we can see a separating region. The histogram based techniques explore patterns like these.\n\nThe technique is actually very simple. We first model one histogram per feature in the normal training data.

On one hand, the histogram based technique overcame the limitation of only representing a Gaussian distribution; on the other, it does not capture any relations between variables. We believe this drawback is responsible for the decrease in performance we observed here. In the case of detecting fraudulent transaction we can easily think of attribute values that are themselves frequent, but a combination of them might not be. For example, consider spending before 6:00am and spending over $1000. Each of this behaviors are frequent, but they unlikely co-occur.\n\n## Cluster based technique\n\nCluster techniques are unsupervised machine learning methods used to group similar data together. Here, we explore it as a semi-supervised technique that assumes that the \"*Normal data instances lie close to their closest cluster centroid, while anomalies are far away from their closest cluster centroid*\". We will use an EM algorithm to cluster the data into \\(n\\) Gaussian. Than, at test time, we will compute the probability of the data \\(P(x)\\) as probability that the instance belongs to each of the fitted Gaussian.\n\nThis mixture of Gaussian model again assumes that the data comes from a mixture of Gaussian distribution. Although in theory this is sufficient to represent any distribution, provided we have the enough centroids, fitting too many clusters will cause over fitting in the sense that even anomalies will have high probability under the model distribution. Therefore, we are better of not using do many Gaussian and hence not perfectly capturing distributions like the one we saw above form the `Amount` in normal transactions. However, if the feature distributions can be well approximately by a mixture of Gaussian `(`like that one we saw in feature `V10` for the anomalous data `)`, will capture the data generating process very well. Furthermore, if we use full covariance matrix for the Gaussian, we will also account for correlations between features and overcome the limitations we noticed in the histogram based technique.\n\nOne drawback we have compared to the simple multivariate Gaussian method we used is that in the mixture of Gaussian, the number of Gaussian to fit is a hyper-parameter we also have to tune. We did this using the validation set and found 3 Gaussian to be optimal in this dataset. Another disadvantage of this technique is that it is sensitive to the starting location of the centroid and random restarts might be needed to avoid high cost local minimum.  Here, we use 4 random restarts."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b89e39cc-679e-88e2-dcc8-a897772c5cfb","_uuid":"b321af65e309fa4fd7c82e4877f1da0a60ecedfd","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.mixture import GaussianMixture\n\ngmm = GaussianMixture(n_components=3, n_init=4, random_state=42)\ngmm.fit(train.drop('Class', axis=1).values)\nprint(gmm.score(valid[valid['Class'] == 0].drop('Class', axis=1).values))\nprint(gmm.score(valid[valid['Class'] == 1].drop('Class', axis=1).values))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"773efd0d-8bbd-ac74-868d-82b2075f677b","_uuid":"e5d460f61e3f8494b9fae5ed72901bf7ef310767"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now, also using the validation set, we tune a threshold that will be used to classify data as normal or anomalous."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"a8a8bc41-02ac-24ba-9017-507ada5c101e","_uuid":"f460ff9e5f55572a4aa4265772061dab35b9a107","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"tresholds = np.linspace(-400, 0, 100)\ny_scores = gmm.score_samples(valid.drop('Class', axis=1).values)\nscores = []\nfor treshold in tresholds:\n    y_hat = (y_scores < treshold).astype(int)\n    scores.append([recall_score(y_pred=y_hat, y_true=valid['Class'].values),\n                 precision_score(y_pred=y_hat, y_true=valid['Class'].values),\n                 fbeta_score(y_pred=y_hat, y_true=valid['Class'].values, beta=2)])\n\nscores = np.array(scores)\nprint(scores[:, 2].max(), scores[:, 2].argmax())","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"3f68e1e9-7fa0-4f71-4b9e-e366f0cbf533","_uuid":"a61c8fe7c7f53df8027f7a3fb3ba2757df504333","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.plot(tresholds, scores[:, 0], label='$Recall$')\nplt.plot(tresholds, scores[:, 1], label='$Precision$')\nplt.plot(tresholds, scores[:, 2], label='$F_2$')\nplt.ylabel('Score')\nplt.xlabel('Threshold')\nplt.legend(loc='best')\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"5eb1e179-bcd6-1ca1-a64f-b9ac86125e3a","_uuid":"97591d17f6f10dab3c4ef282c06a08af40efce2e"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Finally, with the trained and tuned model, we produce a final evaluation on the test set."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"1636c82e-d0a9-74f3-d439-72a5ab88abaa","_uuid":"bae066461d42f3217d2b829031f4e3b009adfd91","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"final_tresh = tresholds[scores[:, 2].argmax()]\ny_hat_test = (gmm.score_samples(test.drop('Class', axis=1).values) < final_tresh).astype(int)\n\nprint('Final threshold: %f' % final_tresh)\nprint('Test Recall Score: %.3f' % recall_score(y_pred=y_hat_test, y_true=test['Class'].values))\nprint('Test Precision Score: %.3f' % precision_score(y_pred=y_hat_test, y_true=test['Class'].values))\nprint('Test F2 Score: %.3f' % fbeta_score(y_pred=y_hat_test, y_true=test['Class'].values, beta=2))\n\ncnf_matrix = confusion_matrix(test['Class'].values, y_hat_test)\nplot_confusion_matrix(cnf_matrix, classes=['Normal','Anormal'], title='Confusion matrix')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"df0c8a01-086c-3e41-0618-4830aeda6d44","_uuid":"446405c90f4ff49e222567941b1e02a75d80705a"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We can see that the \\(F_2\\) is very good for this mixture of Gaussian model.

Some disadvantages, as noted by Chandola et al, are that (1) this technique detect anomalies as a by-product of clustering and are not optimized for anomaly detection and `(`2`)` their computational complexity are often bottlenecks for large datasets.\n\nUntil now, the techniques we've considered assumed that the data came from a particular distribution or could not capture the relationship between different features in the data. We will now turn our attention to methods that have the potential to universally approximate any probability distributions. This does not mean they are better. As we will see, this extra capacity often yield worse results than the simpler methods, probably because the boundaries produced by them are too complex, causing overfitting.\n\n## Support Vector Machines based techniques\n\nJust like the multivariate Gaussian method, this technique finds a region that contains the normal training data. But now we are no longer limited to learning and ellipsoid shaped boundary. The support vector machine techniques fits a one class SVM to the data and uses kernels to learn arbitrarily shaped boundaries. The way this SVM works is that we first project the data onto a space with larger `(`possibly infinite`)` dimensions, where we can encapsulate the normal data in a hypersphere, even if no hypersphere could capture all data in the original space. At evaluation time, we use the distance from the boundary as a score, where negative scores means the data falls outside this boundary. As this projection operations is often to costly, we use the kernel trick to define the distance metric in the projection space without having to visit it at all.\n\nOBS: Unfortunately, it takes too ling to run the SVM on Kaggle server, so if you want to see the result, I suggest that you download the notebook and run it locally."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"73f63e8a-7147-b788-8412-68dee272ce9f","_uuid":"1e7e657df2b7bea0b5dd605f6a8f5542311dba19","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"# from sklearn.svm import OneClassSVM\n# np.random.seed(42)\n\n# model = OneClassSVM(gamma=0.000562, nu=.95, kernel='rbf')\n# model.fit(train.drop('Class', axis=1).values)\n# print(model.decision_function(valid[valid['Class'] == 0].drop('Class', axis=1).values).mean())\n# print(model.decision_function(valid[valid['Class'] == 1].drop('Class', axis=1).values).mean())","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"9ee94de0-069a-46e5-da76-892311d05857","_uuid":"12f2a329d2a0fc5bdd605e98fe063618e4083c07"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We have to use the validation set to tune both the hyper-parameters of the one class SVM and the threshold.

Here, we will use an isolation forest that \"isolates’ observations by randomly selecting a feature and then randomly selecting a split value between the maximum and minimum values of the selected feature\" `(`from the Sklearn documentation`)`. \"In a data-induced random tree, partitioning of instances are repeated recursively until all instances are isolated. This random partitioning produces noticeable shorter paths for anomalies since `(`a`)` the fewer instances of anomalies result in a smaller number of partitions – shorter paths in a tree structure, and `(`b`)` instances with distinguishable attribute-values are more likely to be separated in early partitioning\" `(`Liu and Kai, 2008`)`. We can then use the average path length for the forest as a score and flag instances with a shorter average path as anomalous transactions.\n\nAgain, this method can approximate any probability distribution. Furthermore, recursively partitioning the feature space scales logarithmically with the data size and each isolation tree can be computed in parallel, making this approach very fast.

Many believe that by learning a good representation of the data we will be able to make our supervised models generalize better. This lead to a huge increase in unsupervised deep learning research and many algorithms are rapidly emerging. Here, we will use a well know and not so new approach of a replicating neural network named the autoencoder. In this technique, a multilayer perceptron with the same number of input and output neurons is trained with maximum likelihood to replicate the input data. To avoid simply learning the identity function, we use a bottleneck layer, with fewer neurons than the input size, thus forcing the network to compress the input in its internal representation.\n\nIf we use only normal data to train the network, we can hope it will learn a good internal representation of it and thus have a low reconstruction error wen asked to replicate normal data. Moreover, as it have never seen how the anomalous data looks like, we also hope that the network will do a poor job reconstructing the anomalies. Hence, we can use the reconstruction error, \\( (\\pmb{\\tilde{x}} - \\pmb{x})^2 \\), as an anomaly score. Is the error is too large, we can then flag the instance as an anomaly.\n\nBelow, build an autoencoder with a bottleneck layer of only 2 neurons."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"2037f42f-de23-b5f7-a166-1e471ea33677","_uuid":"9b2decc7d78a2f00a48939ddb5ab933c2d85ab93","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"import tensorflow as tf\ntf.reset_default_graph()\ntf.set_random_seed(2)\n\nbatch_size = 10000\n\nn_visible = train.drop('Class', axis=1).values.shape[1]\nn_hidden1 = 27\nn_hidden2 = 16\nn_hidden3 = 2\n\nlearning_rate = 0.01\n\n# create node for input data\nX_tf = tf.placeholder(\"float\", [None, n_visible], name='X')\n\n# Paramtetrs initialization\nW1_init = 4 * np.sqrt(6. / (n_visible + n_hidden1))\nW2_init = 4 * np.sqrt(6. / (n_hidden1 + n_hidden2))\nW3_init = 4 * np.sqrt(6. / (n_hidden2 + n_hidden3))\n\nW1 = tf.Variable(tf.random_uniform([n_visible, n_hidden1],\n                                   minval=-W1_init, maxval=W1_init), name='W1')\nb1 = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([n_hidden1]), name='b1')\n\nW2 = tf.Variable(tf.random_uniform([n_hidden1, n_hidden2],\n                                   minval=-W2_init, maxval=W2_init), name='W2')\nb2 = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([n_hidden2]), name='b2')\n\nW3 = tf.Variable(tf.random_uniform([n_hidden2, n_hidden3],\n                                   minval=-W3_init, maxval=W3_init), name='W3')\nb3 = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([n_hidden3]), name='b3')\n\nW3_prime = tf.Variable(tf.random_uniform([n_hidden3, n_hidden2],\n                                   minval=-W3_init, maxval=W3_init), name='W3_prime')  \nb3_prime = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([n_hidden2]), name='b3_prime')\n\nW2_prime = tf.Variable(tf.random_uniform([n_hidden2, n_hidden1],\n                                   minval=-W2_init, maxval=W2_init), name='W2_prime')  \nb2_prime = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([n_hidden1]), name='b2_prime')\n\nW1_prime =  tf.Variable(tf.random_uniform([n_hidden1, n_visible],\n                                   minval=-W1_init, maxval=W1_init), name='W1_prime')\nb1_prime = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([n_visible]), name='b1_prime')\n\n\ndef autoencoder(X_tf):\n    \n    # encoder\n    Y = tf.nn.tanh(tf.matmul(X_tf, W1) + b1)  \n    Y = tf.nn.tanh(tf.matmul(Y, W2) + b2) \n    Y = tf.nn.tanh(tf.matmul(Y, W3) + b3) \n    \n    # decoder\n    Z = tf.nn.tanh(tf.matmul(Y, W3_prime) + b3_prime)\n    Z = tf.nn.tanh(tf.matmul(Z, W2_prime) + b2_prime)  \n    Z = tf.nn.tanh(tf.matmul(Z, W1_prime) + b1_prime)\n    \n    return Z, Y\n\nZ, Y = autoencoder(X_tf)\n\ncost = tf.reduce_mean(tf.pow(X_tf -
