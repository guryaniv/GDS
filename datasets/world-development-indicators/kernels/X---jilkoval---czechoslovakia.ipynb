They had different population (about 65% of the total population lived in the Czech part), industry, agriculture, etc.  However, until 1993 they have been part of one country with common government, currency, centralized economics, foreign trade, and others. The <i>World Development Indicators dataset</i> includes data on both Czech Republic and Slovakia separately (even before 1993). Here, I investigate if the division of Czechoslovakia in 1993 corresponds to any change in the evolution of the indicators for CZ and SK. It is expected that the evolution of some indicators is correlated between both countries while there might be no correlation for others. Has the relative evolution of indicators changed in 1993 when both countries started to be politically independent? Has one of the countries started developing substantially different than the other in 1993? Or the other way around -- have the two countries started evolving more similarly than before the separation (for example because the indicator started to be dominated by external influences)?"], "metadata": {"_uuid": "1a850eb1184a861c4e9206a4b3a61e1a8b02921c", "_cell_guid": "c47bf15e-7bec-484b-842d-509f88d0fef1"}, "cell_type": "markdown"}, {"source": ["# Data\n", "First I read the entire dataset:"], "metadata": {"_uuid": "7ed671c5056f6ad9fa561fcf7af06133379e16c2", "_cell_guid": "63cd4846-dad3-4f1b-bc33-13378f8b65c5"}, "cell_type": "markdown"}, {"source": ["import pandas as pd\n", "import numpy as np\n", "data_all = pd.read_csv('../input/Indicators.csv')"], "metadata": {"_uuid": "4d485971706e8e69d1e48f1881f5eac3e730e367", "_cell_guid": "bf210320-e107-4563-9272-0dc50d794545"}, "outputs": [], "execution_count": null, "cell_type": "code"}, {"source": ["To obtain a list of all indicators, which will be useful later, in the data we run:"], "metadata": {"_uuid": "9650896a2417900410f31d2353e9e521b4a40728", "_cell_guid": "7ebe866d-e381-42c0-9d71-2c15141321cd"}, "cell_type": "markdown"}, {"source": ["# list of all indicators\n", "indicators = data_all['IndicatorName'].unique().tolist()\n", "print(\"There is\", len(indicators), \"indicators in the complete data set.\")"], "metadata": {"_uuid": "699ae8d45752405899367e81d91e40241d1b3b17", "_cell_guid": "9557efdb-d7c8-4c9b-9a84-82f0e2ab0cba"}, "outputs": [], "execution_count": null, "cell_type": "code"}, {"source": ["Next, I filter data for CZ and SK:"], "metadata": {"_uuid": "9914a3d15c94bc8925c963275107c5253b5195f0", "_cell_guid": "66edeb1e-661a-46f2-9109-6a413c125434"}, "cell_type": "markdown"}, {"source": ["filter_cz = data_all['CountryName'] == 'Czech Republic'\n", "data_cz = data_all.loc[filter_cz]\n", "print(\"Dataset for CZ has shape\", data_cz.shape)\n", "\n", "filter_sk = data_all['CountryName'] == 'Slovak Republic'\n", "data_sk = data_all.loc[filter_sk]\n", "print(\"Dataset for SK has shape\", data_sk.shape)"], "metadata": {"_uuid": "837443984511de17c888cac7e1d782422a146541", "_cell_guid": "1f4f1b19-4d4c-4bad-b740-edbfd3e7e7e3"}, "outputs": [], "execution_count": null, "cell_type": "code"}, {"source": ["# Correlation of indicators before and after 1993\n", "To compare the evolution of indicators for both countries, I will identify indicators for which both CZ and SK have sufficient data at the same years.
