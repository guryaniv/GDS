        "# Parallelized Preprocessing of DICOM files\n",
        "This is based on Guido's preprocessing tutorial, but I used Python's joblib method to parallelize the for loop over my 4 CPU cores. I ended up changing the order of operations so that I could efficiently remove the extra space around the lungs. I also made some changes to the functions that were causing me errors (like setting background values to -1 and accounting for files with missing slice thickness).\n",
