Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) Submissions are scored on the root mean squared
error. RMSE is very common and is a suitable general-purpose error metric.
Compared to the Mean Absolute Error, RMSE punishes large errors: RMSE= √ 1 n n
∑ i=1 (yi− ˆ y i)2 , where y hat is the predicted value and y is the original
value.
