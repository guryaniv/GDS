        "From these results, it seems like fertility and infant mortality are most related to life expectancy. Environmental or economic variables seem to have only low influence on life expectancy. For infant mortality, life expectancy at birth would be greatly reduced if a person does not survive beyond 1 year after birth. Countries with high fertility would have many more people competing for resources, so this could be why there is such a decrease in life expectancy. Countries with high fertility also tend to be poorer, however, so the lasso regression could have arbitrary dropped GDP per capita when that was the real predictor of life expectancy.\n",
