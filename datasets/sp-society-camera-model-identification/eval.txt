This competition is evaluated on the weighted categorization accuracy of your
predictions (the percentage of camera models correctly predicted).
weighted_accuracy(y, y ^ )= 1 n ∑ i=1 n w i ( y i = y ^ i ) ∑ w i where n is
the number of samples in the test set, y is the true camera label, y_hat is
the predicted camera label, and w_i is 0.7 for unaltered images, and 0.3 for
altered images. Submission File For each image fname in the test set, you must
predict a the correct camera model. The submission file should contain a
header and have the following format: fname,camera
