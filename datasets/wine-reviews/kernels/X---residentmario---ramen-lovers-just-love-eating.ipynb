At least in the United States, basis of ramen-loving has, at least for the last few decades, come out of the starving poor college student demographic. For lots of undergraduates (and post-graduates too), college expenses and rents preclude eating on anything more than shoe-string budget. If you're a broke-ass college student, ramen probably practical runs in your veins, you eat it so often. Cause it's so cheap. And if you fall in love with it so hard that you continue looking out for those rare ramens years after college, then you're a ramenphile.\n", "\n", "OK, but about something fancier, like wine?
