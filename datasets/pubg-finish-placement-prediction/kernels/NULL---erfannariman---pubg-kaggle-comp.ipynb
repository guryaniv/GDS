Note: Self inflicted damage is subtracted.\n* **headshotKills** - Number of enemy players killed with headshots.\n* **heals** - Number of healing items used.\n* **Id**- Player’s Id\n* **killPlace** - Ranking in match of number of enemy players killed.\n* **killPoints** - Kills-based external ranking of player. (Think of this as an Elo ranking where only kills matter.) If there is a value other than -1 in rankPoints, then any 0 in killPoints should be treated as a “None”.\n* **killStreaks** - Max number of enemy players killed in a short amount of time.\n* **kills** - Number of enemy players killed.\n* **longestKill** - Longest distance between player and player killed at time of death. This may be misleading, as downing a player and driving away may lead to a large longestKill stat.\n* **matchDuration** - Duration of match in seconds.\n* **matchId** - ID to identify match. There are no matches that are in both the training and testing set.\n* **matchType** - String identifying the game mode that the data comes from. The standard modes are “solo”, “duo”, “squad”, “solo-fpp”, “duo-fpp”, and “squad-fpp”; other modes are from events or custom matches.\n* **rankPoints** - Elo-like ranking of player. This ranking is inconsistent and is being deprecated in the API’s next version, so use with caution. Value of -1 takes place of “None”.\n* **revives** - Number of times this player revived teammates.\n* **rideDistance** - Total distance traveled in vehicles measured in meters.\n* **roadKills** - Number of kills while in a vehicle.\n* **swimDistance** - Total distance traveled by swimming measured in meters.\n* **teamKills** - Number of times this player killed a teammate.\n* **vehicleDestroys** - Number of vehicles destroyed.\n* **walkDistance** - Total distance traveled on foot measured in meters.\n* **weaponsAcquired** - Number of weapons picked up.\n* **winPoints** - Win-based external ranking of player. (Think of this as an Elo ranking where only winning matters.) If there is a value other than -1 in rankPoints, then any 0 in winPoints should be treated as a “None”.\n* **groupId** - ID to identify a group within a match. If the same group of players plays in different matches, they will have a different groupId each time.\n* **numGroups** - Number of groups we have data for in the match.\n* **maxPlace** - Worst placement we have data for in the match. This may not match with numGroups, as sometimes the data skips over placements.\n* **winPlacePerc** - The target of prediction. This is a percentile winning placement, where 1 corresponds to 1st place, and 0 corresponds to last place in the match. It is calculated off of maxPlace, not numGroups, so it is possible to have missing chunks in a match."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"3a18887bef12e29add72a591bf0edeefa9616b5e"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**lets check the amount of empty values our training data, known as `NaN`in python** "},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"d991398fc2c958cb03c066566e581014211d007a"},"cell_type":"code","source":"train.isna().sum()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"b23cf1e48cb6f442e4379d74fba2273ce41ade07"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**As we see above, we only have 1 column which only has 1 `NaN`** "},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"scrolled":true,"_uuid":"780fd47baed1002fb64bdab46c53e493a4acdb29"},"cell_type":"code","source":"train[train.winPlacePerc.isna()]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"65bcca860beb495a1ec218d04c8e2fea7512dcda"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Since we have 4.4+ million rows, we can drop these without worrying about losing valuable information, so thats what we gonna do**"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"5c8cd6dc2b235fb17576a1f333c90cc943383699"},"cell_type":"code","source":"train.dropna(how=\"any\", inplace=True)\ntrain.shape","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"c2ef26dfbfa91b4618e5fbce3280c14d2a0c2026"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<b>As we see below, we have 4 object columns (columns with type string), and ML models can only work numbers (number crunching algorithms). <br>\n This means that we have to decide what we are going to do with these columns:\n 1. are we going to exclude them\n 2. are we going to encode them to integers</b>\n \n **Looking at these columns we will only use one column which could have some information that we can use, and that is: `matchType`**  \n **So we will convert this column to integers and use it on our models later**"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"scrolled":true,"_uuid":"7411f291028f91bd8212d09f480eea8cc0514c1c"},"cell_type":"code","source":"train.dtypes[train.dtypes == 'object']","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"941991eda12abfc5e2a32ed50340450fc9e742db"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**To see if we can encode this in a decent way, we have to know the amount of __unique__ values in the `matchType`column**"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"898dd232d249bfa4ce07ed5f666e1710281fa2bf","scrolled":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(f\"amount of unique values in the matchType column is: {train.matchType.value_counts().count()}\")\nprint(\"these are the unique values:\")\ntrain.matchType.value_counts()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"23ceec414c0e807982bcc97278a9e56bc6628208"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**So now we know that we 16 unique values, we can easily encode this column using `one hot encoding`**"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"5caa9aa06816ddeb0377bf6b37d8a8859acd3647","scrolled":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"'''\nWe will use one hot encoding on the matchType series, which will give each unique value its own column.\nThis means that we will get 16 new columns: squad-fpp, duo-fpp, squad, solo-fpp etc.\n'''\none_hot = pd.get_dummies(train.matchType)\ntrain.drop('matchType', axis=1, inplace=True)\ntrain = train.join(one_hot)\ntrain.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"0ef280a13dc71a1b0ec89cd630edd087216e175b"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**now we fixed our matchType column, we have to drop the other 3 `object` columns: Id, groupId, matchId**\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"6926f58e0ae67cb0742141a4dd2f71d3e7277782"},"cell_type":"code","source":"train.drop(['Id', 'groupId', 'matchId'], axis='columns', inplace=True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"scrolled":false,"_uuid":"bba91595814b0646629f7bd71032c822d6d730f8"},"cell_type":"code","source":"train.corr()[round(train.corr(), 2).winPlacePerc > 0.5]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"scrolled":false,"_uuid":"9bfc0f88840953382c562924621df630d496ed8f"},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = plt.figure(1, figsize=(10,10))\nplt.plot(train.walkDistance, train.winPlacePerc, 'o')\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"3daa1f9deb05423561772ec204d4b53bfa1900db"},"cell_type":"code","source":"train.walkDistance.sort_values(ascending=False).head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"495e434d40002483a93d4af18a37956f13c7798c"},"cell_type":"code","source":"train[train.walkDistance == 25780]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
