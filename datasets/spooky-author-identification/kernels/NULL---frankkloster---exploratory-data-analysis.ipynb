This is largely of interest to me for two reasons. First, as an excuse to learn some basic techniques in NLP. Many of these techniques I've learned over these past few months go unused, such as latent Dirichlet allocations and recurrent neural networks. Second, as someone interested in the horror literature as a whole, figured this dataset would be a good place to start.\n\nI will be using several different libraries.\n* **Numpy**, **Pandas**, and **Sklearn** for data analysis and machine learning.\n* **Plotly** for plotting data. I will also be using **Word Cloud** for generating wordclouds.\n---\n\nTo begin, let me start with a following quote.\n\n> \"The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents.\"\n> > HP Lovecraft\n\nWell, I guess he never heard of deep learning techniques!
