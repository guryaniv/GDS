For reference, uncompressed, the training dataset is 4.08 GB, while the test set is 3.53 GB.  As such, when I tried to load the data with a conventional pd.read_csv() function, I don't think I even got a memory error; my computer froze.  I did a Google search and found a quick fix on [github from user lsilva6851](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/16537).  While I managed to finally load the whole dataset, everything was noticably slower, so I decided to only load part of the dataset to see if I could optimize the memory usage.

The caveat is, if there are too many unique values in a feature, converting to categorial could actually increase memory usage.  A quote from the [documentation](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/categorical.html#gotchas): \"If the number of categories approaches the length of the data, the Categorical will use nearly the same or more memory than an equivalent object dtype representation.\".   \n\nUsing the describe function on all object features, we can see a snapshot of how many unique values there are in each column.  The first column, MachineIdentifier, would be a terrible column to change into a categorial type, as every row is a unique value.  However, the next few, ProductName, EngineVersion, and AppVersion, are great examples to convert, having only 2, 36, and 58 unique values out of 10,000 rows.
