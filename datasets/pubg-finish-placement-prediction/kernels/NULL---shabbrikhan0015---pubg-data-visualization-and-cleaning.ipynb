Note: Self inflicted damage is subtracted.\n*     headshotKills - Number of enemy players killed with headshots.\n*     heals - Number of healing items used.\n*     Id - Player’s Id\n*    killPlace - Ranking in match of number of enemy players killed.\n*     killPoints - Kills-based external ranking of player. (Think of this as an Elo ranking where only kills matter.) If there is a value       \n       other than -1 in rankPoints, then any 0 in killPoints should be treated as a “None”.\n*     killStreaks - Max number of enemy players killed in a short amount of time.\n*     kills - Number of enemy players killed.\n*     longestKill - Longest distance between player and player killed at time of death. This may be misleading, as downing a \n       player and driving away may lead to a large longestKill stat.\n*     matchDuration - Duration of match in seconds.\n*     matchId - ID to identify match. There are no matches that are in both the training and testing set.\n*     matchType - String identifying the game mode that the data comes from. The standard modes are “solo”, “duo”, “squad”, “      \n      solo-fpp”, “duo-fpp”, and “squad-fpp”; other modes are from events or custom matches.\n*  rankPoints - Elo-like ranking of player. This ranking is inconsistent and is being deprecated in the API’s next version, so use\n      with caution. Value of -1 takes place of “None”. \n*   revives - Number of times this player revived teammates.\n* rideDistance - Total distance traveled in vehicles measured in meters.\n*   roadKills - Number of kills while in a vehicle.\n*   swimDistance - Total distance traveled by swimming measured in meters.\n*   teamKills - Number of times this player killed a teammate.\n*   vehicleDestroys - Number of vehicles destroyed.\n*   walkDistance - Total distance traveled on foot measured in meters.\n*  weaponsAcquired - Number of weapons picked up.\n*  winPoints - Win-based external ranking of player.

If there is a\n      value other than -1 in rankPoints, then any 0 in winPoints should be treated as a “None”.\n*  groupId - ID to identify a group within a match. If the same group of players plays in different matches, they will have a       \n     different groupId each time.\n*   numGroups - Number of groups we have data for in the match.\n*   maxPlace - Worst placement we have data for in the match. This may not match with numGroups, as sometimes the data   \n    skips over placements.\n* winPlacePerc - The target of prediction. This is a percentile winning placement, where 1 corresponds to 1st place, and 0\n    corresponds to last place in the match. It is calculated off of maxPlace, not numGroups, so it is possible to have missing\n    chunks in a match.\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"72eaf227c41981bb4d622f2345d4bc860f6bf98b"},"cell_type":"code","source":"train.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"ed33b7fcb3f87aceb6c185cd6d7fafa4f41fe032"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Check row with NaN value\ntrain[train['winPlacePerc'].isnull()]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d9cf9b133f66e98aba7bc3c8c1bbdb2257adc595"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### We have to predict \"winPlacePerc\" .So we have to delete 2744604 row where \"winPlacePerc\" is Nan shown above"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"1f94bd5226df3e569f27417e5fb5dad7fd4f4eee"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Delete this player\ntrain.drop(2744604, inplace=True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"cbba8a365e331cb5157b31f934e76f28b5f9560c"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## PLOTS\nNumber of player joined"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"71dd9d1ffe51c7a17bc42172241598235d3c6c60"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# playersJoined\ntrain['playersJoined'] = train.groupby('matchId')['matchId'].transform('count')\nplt.figure(figsize=(15,10))\nsns.countplot(train[train['playersJoined']>=75]['playersJoined'])\nplt.title('playersJoined')\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"1d3b126fb22a4252759e7b78e8998fed8162b2f6"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Number of weapon acquired\nMostly players had less 20 weapon\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"6f4fc46e251d8e4918c606f529751a48e9389fad"},"cell_type":"code","source":"weapon = train[train['weaponsAcquired']<=20]\nsns.countplot(x='weaponsAcquired',data =weapon)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"38d7675571fd3366bb0df5407051d30c794b3b40"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Heals and Boost\nWe create a feature called 'healsandboosts' by adding heals and boosts"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"1df5e66942a2ccd664e77fc07405e7670d7b31fe"},"cell_type":"code","source":"train['healsandboosts'] = train['heals'] + train['boosts']\ntrain[['heals', 'boosts', 'healsandboosts']].tail()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"9d5437d12ed64232fffdfd490d05f7af092663e6"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Killing without moving\nWe try to identify cheaters by checking if people are getting kills without moving.
