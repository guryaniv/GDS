These methods start with a simple tour joining two nodes. The remaining nodes are inserted into the path according to some selection process. The process shown here is known as Farthest Insertion, where at each selection step, the node found to be the most distant from any node on the current path is selected to be inserted next. While this sounds counterintuitive, it has been empirically found to perform better than other insertion methods as well as simple nearest neighbor construction algorithms. \n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  Start with an initial high cost edge between two nodes.\n\n2. From the remaining nodes available, find the node most distant from the two nodes found in Step 1. Add this node to your path, making a complete 3-node tour.\n\n3. With the remaining nodes, continue this selection process. Find the node most distant from all of your already-selected nodes. Insert this node (*not append*) between the nearest edge {i, j} on the tour, essentially breaking it up. When there are no more nodes left to select, you're done.\n\nA visual example of this algorithm can be found at the website linked below.\n\n[https://users.cs.cf.ac.uk/C.L.Mumford/howard/FarthestInsertion.html](https://users.cs.cf.ac.uk/C.L.Mumford/howard/FarthestInsertion.html)\n\nWith that, let's get to coding"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"d8b77fc4d9c622ebabfd5839ec4c178bc2dfdafc"},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nimport sympy as sym\n\nimport time\n\nfrom scipy.spatial import ConvexHull, distance_matrix\nfrom scipy.spatial.distance import cdist, pdist","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"e4c79b528cbc5e28741408e3719c90f45f848beb"},"cell_type":"code","source":"cities = pd.read_csv(\"../input/cities.csv\")\navailable_nodes = set(cities.CityId.values)\npositions = np.array([cities.X.values, cities.Y.values]).T","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"cbd90e79eb8c84faf1cfb78ea6e9550ccfe240da"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Step 1** \n\nIn this kernel, I initialize the tour using the two most distant cities in the dataset.

From there select the two most-distant using a brute force search. I can get away with this because the convex hull consists of only 20-something points.
