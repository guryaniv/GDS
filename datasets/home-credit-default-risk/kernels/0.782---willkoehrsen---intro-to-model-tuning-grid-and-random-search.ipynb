[In contrast](https://machinelearningmastery.com/difference-between-a-parameter-and-a-hyperparameter/) to model __parameters__ which are learned during training, model __hyperparameters__ are set by the data scientist ahead of training and control implementation aspects of the model. The weights learned during training of a linear regression model are parameters while the number of trees in a random forest is a model hyperparameter because this is set by the data scientist. Hyperparameters can be thought of as model settings. These settings need to be tuned for each problem because the best model hyperparameters for one particular dataset will __not be__ the best across all datasets. The process of [hyperparameter tuning (also called hyperparameter optimization)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_optimization) means finding the combination of hyperparameter values for a machine learning model that performs the best - as measured on a validation dataset - for a problem. \n\n(__Quick Note__: a lot of data scientists use the terms _parameters_ and _hyperparameters_ interchangeably to refer to the model settings. While this is technically incorrect, it's pretty common practice and it's usually possible to tell when they are referring to parameters learned during training versus hyperparameters. I'll try to stick to using model hyperparameters or model settings and I'll  point out when I'm talking about a parameter that is learned during training. If you're still confused, [this article](https://machinelearningmastery.com/difference-between-a-parameter-and-a-hyperparameter/) may help you out!)\n\n__Additional Notebooks__ \n\nIf you haven't checked out my other work on this problem, here is a complete list of the notebooks I have completed so far:\n\n* [A Gentle Introduction](https://www.kaggle.com/willkoehrsen/start-here-a-gentle-introduction)\n* [Manual Feature Engineering Part One](https://www.kaggle.com/willkoehrsen/introduction-to-manual-feature-engineering)\n* [Manual Feature Engineering Part Two](https://www.kaggle.com/willkoehrsen/introduction-to-manual-feature-engineering-p2)\n* [Introduction to Automated Feature Engineering](https://www.kaggle.com/willkoehrsen/automated-feature-engineering-basics)\n* [Advanced Automated Feature Engineering](https://www.kaggle.com/willkoehrsen/tuning-automated-feature-engineering-exploratory)\n* [Feature Selection](https://www.kaggle.com/willkoehrsen/introduction-to-feature-selection)\n* [Intro to Model Tuning: Grid and Random Search](https://www.kaggle.com/willkoehrsen/intro-to-model-tuning-grid-and-random-search)\n* [Automated Model Tuning](https://www.kaggle.com/willkoehrsen/automated-model-tuning)\n\nThere are several approaches to hyperparameter tuning\n\n1. __Manual__: select hyperparameters based on intuition/experience/guessing, train the model with the hyperparameters, and score on the validation data. Repeat process until you run out of patience or are satisfied with the results. \n2. __Grid Search__: set up a grid of hyperparameter values and for each combination, train a model and score on the validation data. In this approach, every single combination of hyperparameters values is tried which can be very inefficient!\n3. __Random search__: set up a grid of hyperparameter values and select _random_ combinations to train the model and score. The number of search iterations is set based on time/resources. \n4. __Automated Hyperparameter Tuning__: use methods such as gradient descent, Bayesian Optimization, or evolutionary algorithms to conduct a guided search for the best hyperparameters.\n\n(This [Wikipedia Article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_optimization) provides a good high-level overview of tuning options with links for more details)\n\nIn this notebook, we will implement approaches 2 and 3 for a Gradient Boosting Machine Learning Model. In a future notebook, we will implement automated hyperparameter tuning using Bayesian optimization, specifically the Hyperopt library. If you want to get an idea of how automated hyperparameter tuning is done, check out [this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/automated-machine-learning-hyperparameter-tuning-in-python-dfda59b72f8a). \n\n## Model: Gradient Boosting Machine \n\nThe [Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)](https://machinelearningmastery.com/gentle-introduction-gradient-boosting-algorithm-machine-learning/) has recently emerged as one of the top machine learning models. The GBM is extremely effective on structured data - where the information is in rows and columns - and medium sized datasets - where there are at most a few million observations. We will focus on this model because it is currently the top performing method for most competitions on Kaggle and because the performance is highly dependent on the hyperparameter choices. The basics you need to know about the GBM are that it is an ensemble method that works by training many individual learners, almost always decision trees. However, unlike in a random forest where the trees are trained in __parallel__, in a GBM, the trees are trained __sequentially__ with each tree learning from the mistakes of the previous ones. The hundreds or thousands of weak learners are combined to make a single strong ensemble learner with the contributions of each individual learned during training using Gradient Descent (the weights of the individual trees would therefore be a model _parameter_). \n\nThe GBM [has many hyperparameters to tune](http://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Parameters.html) that control both the overall ensemble (such as the learning rate) and the individual decision trees (such as the number of leaves in the tree or the maximum depth of the tree). It is difficult to know which combination of hyperparameters will work best based only on theory because there are complex interactions between hyperparameters. Hence the need for hyperparameter tuning: the only way to find the optimal hyperparameter values is to try many different combinations on a dataset!\n\nWe will use the implementation of the Gradient Boosting Machine in the [LightGBM library](http://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). This is a much faster (and some say more accurate) implementation than that available in Scikit-Learn.\n\nFor more details of the Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), check out this [high-level blog post](http://blog.kaggle.com/2017/01/23/a-kaggle-master-explains-gradient-boosting/), or this [in depth technical article.](https://brage.bibsys.no/xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/2433761/16128_FULLTEXT.pdf) \n\n### Getting Started\n\nWith the necessary background out of the way, let's get started. For this notebook, we will work with a subset of the data consisting of 10000 rows. Hyperparameter tuning is extremely computationally expensive and working with the full dataset in a Kaggle Kernel would not be feasible for more than a few search iterations. However, the same ideas that we will implement here can be applied to the full dataset and while this notebook is specifically aimed at the GBM, the methods can be applied for any machine learning model. \n\nTo \"test\" the tuning results, we will save some of the training data, 6000 rows, as a separate testing set. When we do hyperparameter tuning, it's crucial to __not tune the hyperparameters on the testing data__. We can only use the testing data __a single time__ when we evaluate the final model that has been tuned on the validation data. To actually test our methods from this notebook, we would need to train the best model on all of the training data, make predictions on the actual testing data, and then submit our answers to the competition.

The hyperparameters __can not be tuned on the testing data__. We can only use the testing data __once__ when we evaluate the final model. The testing data is meant to serve as an estimate of the model performance when deployed on real data, and therefore we do not want to optimize our model to the testing data because that will not give us a fair estimate of the actual performance. The correct approach is therefore to use a validation set. However, instead of splitting the valuable training data into a separate training and validation set, we use [KFold cross validation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIgfjmp-4BA). In addition to preserving training data, this should give us a better estimate of generalization performance on the test set than using a single validation set (since then we are probably overfitting to that validation set). The performance of each set of hyperparameters is determined by Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve (ROC AUC) from the cross-validation.\n\nIn this example, we will use 5-fold cross validation which means training and testing the model with each set of hyperparameter values 5 times to assess performance. Part of the reason why hyperparameter tuning is so time-consuming is because of the use of cross validation. If we have a [large enough training set, we can probably get away with just using a single separate validation set](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/deep-neural-network/train-dev-test-sets-cxG1s), but cross validation is a safer method to avoid overfitting. \n\nTo implement KFold cross validation, we will use the LightGBM cross validation function, `cv`, because this allows us to use a critical technique for training a GBM, early stopping. (For other machine learning models where we do not need to use early stopping, we can use the Scikit-Learn functions `RandomizedSearchCV` or `GridSearchCV`.)\n\n## Early Stopping\n\nOne of the most important hyperparameters in a Gradient Boosting Machine is the number of estimators (the number of decision trees trained sequentially). We could set this as another hyperparameter in our search, but there's a better method: [early stopping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_stopping). Early stopping means training until the validation error does not decrease for a specified number of iterations. In the case of the GBM, this means training more decision trees, and in this example, we will use early stopping with 100 rounds, meaning that the training will continue until validation error has not decreased for 100 rounds. Then, the number of estimators that yielded the best score on the validation data will be chosen as the number of estimators to use in the final model.\n\nThe concept of early stopping is commonly applied to the GBM and to deep neural networks so it's a great technique to understand. This is one of many forms of regularization that aims to improve generalization performance on the testing set by not overfitting to the training data. If we keep adding estimators, the training error will always decrease because the capacity of the model increases. Although this might seem positive, it means that the model will start to memorize the training data and then will not perform well on new testing data. The __variance__ of the model increases as we continue adding estimators because the model starts to rely too heavily on the training data (high variance means overfitting).\n\nEarly stopping is simple to implement with the LightGBM library in the cross validation function. We simply need to pass in the number of early stopping rounds.\n\n### Example of Cross Validation and Early Stopping \n\nTo use the `cv` function, we first need to make a LightGBM `dataset`.

The basic strategy for both grid and random search is simple: for each hyperparameter value combination, evaluate the cross validation score and record the results along with the hyperparameters. Then, at the end of searching, choose the hyperparameters that yielded the highest cross-validation score, train the model on all the training data, and make predictions on the test data.\n\n# Four parts of Hyperparameter tuning\n\nIt's helpful to think of hyperparameter tuning as having four parts (these four parts also will form the basis of Bayesian Optimization):\n\n1. Objective function: a function that takes in hyperparameters and returns a score we are trying to minimize or maximize\n2. Domain: the set of hyperparameter values over which we want to search. \n3. Algorithm: method for selecting the next set of hyperparameters to evaluate in the objective function.\n4. Results history: data structure containing each set of hyperparameters and the resulting score from the objective function.\n\nSwitching from grid to random search to Bayesian optimization will only require making minor modifications to these four parts. \n\n## Objective Function\n\nThe objective function takes in hyperparameters and outputs a value representing a score. Traditionally in optimization, this is a score to minimize, but here our score will be the ROC AUC which of course we want to maximize. Later, when we get to Bayesian Optimization, we will have to use a value to minimize, so we can take $1 - \\text{ROC AUC}$ as the score. What occurs in the middle of the objective function will vary according to the problem, but for this problem, we will use cross validation with the specified model hyperparameters to get the cross-validation ROC AUC. This score will then be used to select the best model hyperparameter values. \n\nIn addition to returning the value to maximize, our objective function will return the hyperparameters and the iteration of the search. These results will let us go back and inspect what occurred during a search. The code below implements a simple objective function which we can use for both grid and random search."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"9d904f4e3ffb10d2a9b1748fb0c236101486ede0","trusted":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def objective(hyperparameters, iteration):\n    \"\"\"Objective function for grid and random search.

You can also refer to the [LightGBM documentation](http://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Parameters.html) for the description of all the hyperparameters."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"02a083d4b41697c47dcb21c48bc543c05cb4a4e8","trusted":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Create a default model\nmodel = lgb.LGBMModel()\nmodel.get_params()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"34854c78b2359cee125731d4f8848ca40aa08527"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Some of these we do not need to tune such as `silent`, `objective`, `random_state`, and `n_jobs`, and we will use early stopping to determine perhaps the most important hyperparameter, the number of individual learners trained, `n_estimators` (also referred to as `num_boost_rounds` or the number of iterations). Some of the hyperparameters do not need to be tuned if others are: for example, `min_child_samples` and `min_child_weight` both limit the complexity of individual decision trees by adjusting the minimum leaf observation requirements and therefore we will only adjust one. However, there are still many hyperparameters to optimize, and we will choose 10 to tune. \n\nChoosing a hyperparameter grid is probably the most difficult part of hyperparameter tuning: it's nearly impossible ahead of time to say which values of hyperparameters will work well and the optimal settings will depend on the dataset. Moreover, the hyperparameters have complex interactions with each other which means that just tuning one at a time doesn't work because when we start changing other hyperparameters that will affect the one we just tuned! \n\nIf we have prior experience with a model, we might know where the best values for the hyperparameters typically lie, or what a good search space is. However, if we don't have much experience, we can simply define a large search space and hope that the best values are in there somewhere. Typically, when first using a method, I define a wide search space centered around the default values. Then, if I see that some values of hyperparameters tend to work better, I can concentrate the search around those values. \n\nA complete grid for the 10 hyperparameter is defined below.

The key line is `for v in itertools.product(*values)` where we iterate through all the possible combinations of values in the hyperparameter grid one at a time.  For each combination of values, we create a dictionary `hyperparameters = dict(zip(keys, v))` and then pass these to the objective function defined earlier.

Use random search with  a large hyperparameter grid \n2. Use the results of random search to build a focused hyperparameter grid around the best performing hyperparameter values.\n3. Run grid search on the reduced hyperparameter grid. \n4. Repeat grid search on more focused grids until maximum computational/time budget is exceeded.\n\nIn a later notebook (upcoming), we will look at methods that use the past evaluation results to pick the next hyperparameter values to try in the objective function. These methods (including [Bayesian optimization](https://sigopt.com/static/pdf/SigOpt_Bayesian_Optimization_Primer.pdf)) are essentially doing what we would do in the strategy outlined above: adjust the next values tried in the search from the previous results. The overall objective of these _informed methods_ is to limit evaluations of the objective function by reasoning about the next values to try based on past evaluation results. These algorithms are therefore able to save time by evaluating more promising values of hyperparameters. This is a really cool topic and [Bayesian optimization](http://gpss.cc/gpmc17/slides/LancasterMasterclass_1.pdf) is fascinating so stay tuned for this upcoming notebook.

These search methods are very expensive, so expect the hyperparameter tuning to take a while.(I am currently running this script on a full set of features for 500 iterations and will make the results public when they are available. )\n\nFor now, we will turn to implementing random and grid search on the reduced dataset for 1000 iterations just to compare the results (I took the code below and already ran it because even with the small dataset, it takes a very long time. The results are available as part of the data in this kernel). \n\n## Writing to File to Monitor Progress\n\nWhen we run these searches for a long time, it's natural to want to track the performance while the search is going on. We can print information to the command prompt, but this will grow cluttered after 1000 iterations and the results will be gone if we close the command prompt. A better solution (although not perfect) is to write a line to a csv (comma separated value) file on each iteration. Then, we can look at the file to track progress while the searching is running, and eventually, have the entire results saved when the search is complete.\n\n### Extremely Important Note about Checking Files\n\nWhen you want to check the csv file, __do not open it in Excel while the search is ongoing__. This will cause a permission error in Python and the search will be terminated. Instead, you can view the end of the file by typing `tail out_file.csv` from Bash where `out_file.csv` is the name of the file being written to. There are also some text editors, such as notepad or Sublime Text, where you can open the results safely while the search is occurring.

The results are likely to be different because we were only using a random subset of the training data. However, this will take much longer (300000+ observations instead of 10000). I'm currently running the random search on the full dataset from the Kernel referenced above, and will see how the results turn out. (Sampling some of the observations is not inherently negative, and it can help us get reasonable answers in a much shorter time frame. However, if we are using such a small portion of the data that is not representative of the entire dataset, then we should not expect the tuning to translate to the full dataset.)\n\nIn an upcoming notebook, we will turn to automated hyperparameter tuning, in particular, Bayesian Optimization. We will implement automated optimization of machine learning hyperparameters step-by-step using the Hyperopt open-source Python library. I'll provide the link here as soon as this notebook is finished, but if you want to get an idea of Bayesian optimization, you can check out [this introductory article](https://towardsdatascience.com/an-introductory-example-of-bayesian-optimization-in-python-with-hyperopt-aae40fff4ff0), or [this article on automated hyperparameter tuning](https://towardsdatascience.com/automated-machine-learning-hyperparameter-tuning-in-python-dfda59b72f8a).

Random and grid search are two uniformed methods for hyperparameter tuning that search by selecting hyperparameter values from a grid domain. \nThe four parts of hyperparameter tuning are:\n\n1. Objective function: takes in hyperparameters and returns the cross validation score we want to maximize or minimize\n2. Domain of hyperparameters: values over which we want to search\n3. Algorithm: method for selecting the next hyperparameter values to evaluate in the objective function\n4. Results: history of hyperparameters and cross validation scores\n\nThese four parts apply to grid and random search as well as to Bayesian optimization, a form of automated hyperparameter tuning. In this notebook, we implemented both random and grid search on a reduced dataset, inspected the results, and tried to translate the optimal hyperparameters to a full dataset (from [this kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/jsaguiar/updated-0-792-lb-lightgbm-with-simple-features)). As a small note, it's important to remember that we tune the hyperparameters to the training data - using cross validation - so the hyperparameter values we find are only optimal for the training data. Although the best hyperparameters from the smaller dataset did not work that well on the full dataset, we were still able to see the ideas behind these two tuning methods. Moreover, we can take the functions developed here and apply them to any dataset or to any machine learning model, not just the gradient boosting machine. \n\nRandom search turns out to work pretty well in practice (because it is good at exploring the search domain), but it still is not a reasoning method because it does not use past evaluation results to choose the next hyperparameter values. A better approach would be to use the past results to reason about the best values to try next in the objective function, especially because as we saw, evaluating the objective function is time-consuming! In future work, we will look at [implementing automated hyperparameter tuning](https://towardsdatascience.com/automated-machine-learning-hyperparameter-tuning-in-python-dfda59b72f8a) using Bayesian optimization. \n\nHyperparameter tuning is a crucial part of the machine learning pipeline because the performance of a model can depend strongly on the choices of the hyperparameter values. Random and grid search are two decent methods to start tuning a model (at least they are better than manual tuning) and are important tools to have in the data science skillset.
