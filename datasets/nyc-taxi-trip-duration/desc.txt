In this competition, Kaggle is challenging you to build a model that predicts
the total ride duration of taxi trips in New York City. Your primary dataset
is one released by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission, which includes
pickup time, geo-coordinates, number of passengers, and several other
variables. Longtime Kagglers will recognize that this competition objective is
similar to the ECML/PKDD trip time challenge we hosted in 2015. But, this
challenge comes with a twist. Instead of awarding prizes to the top finishers
on the leaderboard, this playground competition was created to reward
collaboration and collective learning. We are encouraging you (with cash
prizes!) to publish additional training data that other participants can use
for their predictions. We also have designated bi-weekly and final prizes to
reward authors of kernels that are particularly insightful or valuable to the
community.
