An existential problem for any major website today is how to handle toxic and
divisive content. Quora wants to tackle this problem head-on to keep their
platform a place where users can feel safe sharing their knowledge with the
world. Quora is a platform that empowers people to learn from each other. On
Quora, people can ask questions and connect with others who contribute unique
insights and quality answers. A key challenge is to weed out insincere
questions -- those founded upon false premises, or that intend to make a
statement rather than look for helpful answers. In this competition, Kagglers
will develop models that identify and flag insincere questions. To date, Quora
has employed both machine learning and manual review to address this problem.
With your help, they can develop more scalable methods to detect toxic and
misleading content. Here's your chance to combat online trolls at scale. Help
Quora uphold their policy of “Be Nice, Be Respectful” and continue to be a
place for sharing and growing the world’s knowledge. Important Note Be aware
that this is being run as a Kernels Only Competition, requiring that all
submissions be made via a Kernel output. Please read the Kernels FAQ and the
data page very carefully to fully understand how this is designed.
