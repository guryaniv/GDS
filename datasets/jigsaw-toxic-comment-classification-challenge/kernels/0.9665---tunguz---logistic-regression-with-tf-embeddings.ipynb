However, these feature speaces are really large and sparse - 50,000+ sparse features! Since the competition ended, a few good sentence embedding schemes have popped up. These allow for an automattic embedding of whole sentences into realtively low-lever vector spaces (a few thousand dimensions at most). I wanted to chekc how well these embeddings could be used for the classification of Toxic comments. It took me a few months of wrestling with Kaggle's onlline environment to get at least one of them working (TF Embeddings), but thus far the results are not too encouraging. The logistic regression, as run below, gives LB score of 0.966x, as opposed to almost 0.98 with TF-IDF.
