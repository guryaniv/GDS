Steller sea lions in the western Aleutian Islands have declined 94 percent in
the last 30 years. The endangered western population, found in the North
Pacific, are the focus of conservation efforts which require annual population
counts. Specially trained scientists at NOAA Fisheries Alaska Fisheries
Science Center conduct these surveys using airplanes and unoccupied aircraft
systems to collect aerial images. Having accurate population estimates enables
us to better understand factors that may be contributing to lack of recovery
of Stellers in this area. Currently, it takes biologists up to four months to
count sea lions from the thousands of images NOAA Fisheries collects each
year. Once individual counts are conducted, the tallies must be reconciled to
confirm their reliability. The results of these counts are time-sensitive. In
this competition, Kagglers are invited to develop algorithms which accurately
count the number of sea lions in aerial photographs. Automating the annual
population count will free up critical resources allowing NOAA Fisheries to
focus on ensuring we hear the sea lionâ€™s roar for many years to come. Plus,
advancements in computer vision applied to aerial population counts may also
greatly benefit other endangered species. Resources Learn more about research
