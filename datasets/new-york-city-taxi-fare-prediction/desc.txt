In this playground competition, hosted in partnership with Google Cloud and
Coursera, you are tasked with predicting the fare amount (inclusive of tolls)
for a taxi ride in New York City given the pickup and dropoff locations. While
you can get a basic estimate based on just the distance between the two
points, this will result in an RMSE of $5-$8, depending on the model used (see
the starter code for an example of this approach in Kernels). Your challenge
is to do better than this using Machine Learning techniques! To learn how to
handle large datasets with ease and solve this problem using TensorFlow,
consider taking the Machine Learning with TensorFlow on Google Cloud Platform
specialization on Coursera -- the taxi fare problem is one of several real-
world problems that are used as case studies in the series of courses. To make
this easier, head to Coursera.org/NEXTextended to claim this specialization
for free for the first month!
