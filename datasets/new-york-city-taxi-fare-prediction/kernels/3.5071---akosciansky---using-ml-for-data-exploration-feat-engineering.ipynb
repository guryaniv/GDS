If a feature turns out to be 100 times more important than another feature, then I will spend 100 times more time on it.\n\nThe steps I will take are:\n\n1. Read in a subset of the entire dataset\n2. Do some initial data processing, feature engineering and handle missing data using the fast AI library\n3. Run a simple Random Forest\n4. Get the Feature Importances\n5.

Geographical features were by far the most important and some additional features based on them should be built such as Manhattan distance\n2. Additional data sources including weather or holidays would be a useful complement\n3. Do a similar analysis on test and train data that was done on months and years but on longitudes and latitudes - this can also be done on the entire dataset if you read it in in chunks\n4. Look at missing data in more detail. I have skimmed over this here and simply imputed them using the mean\n5. Do an actual prediction. Random Forest gives good intial results but other algorithms will be necessary to increase the accuracy. Neural networks have the advantage that they can extrapolate, i.e. make a prediction on data (like longitudes outside the training set longitudes) they haven't seen before, which is something a Random Forest cannot do. RF will do a prediction but it won't be very good.\n6. Remove features with low feature importance and check the results.
