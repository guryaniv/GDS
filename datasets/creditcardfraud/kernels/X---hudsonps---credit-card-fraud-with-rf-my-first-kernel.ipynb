Not everything is perfect, but I hope that my analysis brings some insight into the problem and help others that are also starting at Kaggle.\n\nIn this kernel, I investigate the credit card fraud dataset and ultimately opt for working with a random forest model.\nThis dataset provides us with data in the form of PCA components, the amounts associated with each transaction, the time at which they occurred (in this kernel, we have not explored this variable, but based on other kernels, it does not seem to play a key role), and whether a given transaction is fraudulent or not.\nIn the first part of this kernel, we do a uni/bi-variate analysis to determine what PCA components might be more relevant in drawing a line between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions. This is used to reduce the dimensionality of this problem.\n\nIn the second part, we look at the variable amount in more detail. We find that quite a few transactions, fraudulent or not, correspond to an amount of 0. We eliminated these transactions on the basis that they do not aggregate any immediate financial value. Perhaps given more context for the problem, it would make sense to retain these transactions.\n\nOur investigation also reveals that the only a small subset of the fraudulent transactions (about 150 of the total 492 fraudulent transactions) account for about 95% of the total amount loss due to frauds. We felt like it would be better to create a separate model to account for the small-amount transactions. This seemly led to small improvements in the recall metric for fraudulent transactions without affecting the precision much."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","collapsed":true,"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, cross_val_score, cross_val_predict\nfrom sklearn import metrics\nfrom sklearn import neighbors\nimport os\nimport numpy as np\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\nfrom sklearn import preprocessing\nfrom sklearn import decomposition\nfrom sklearn import ensemble\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold\nfrom sklearn.metrics import roc_curve, auc\nfrom sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV\nimport scipy\nfrom scipy.stats import spearmanr\nfrom scipy.stats import ks_2samp","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"04c3eda627a4b10e9de6c673e97c98fd5d74ab35","collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#importing the dataset \nrawdf = pd.read_csv(\"../input/creditcard.csv\", delimiter = \",\")\nrawdf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"753c2a343922a62dbee04c3de281e9722bcafdcd"},"cell_type":"code","source":"rawdf.shape","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"72aa58e8213c06d19783899669c506be101975d7"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Time seems to represent the time at which the transaction happened.
