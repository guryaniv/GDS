India has one of the highest GDP in Asia so it would be beneficial to compare it with other countries in the region with a similar GDP. It would not be helpful to compare student enrollment based on exact number of enrolled students because of the large difference in population between the countries. Instead, I looked at the gross enrollment ratio, which might be a better indicator when comparing student enrollment in different countries. "

        "We can observe from the primary enrollment ratio graph, that India has steady increased in primary enrollment over the years. It appears that most other countries with high GDPs in Asia also have a high primary enrollment ratio. It is important to note that it is possible to go over 100 when it comes to gross enrollment ratio (GER) as we can see with all of the five countries in the graph. The GER is the ratio of the number of students enrolled in school to the number of children in the country of the corresponding age. The GER can be above 100 as a result of students repeating grades and from students enrolling in the grade earlier or later than the normal age for the grade. \n",

However, all three of these countries (India, China and Indonesia) are seeing a consistent increase in secondary education GER. There increase is almost the same for the three countries. Japan is consistently at 100 which means that almost all the children of school age are enrolled in school. The one outlier in recent years is Russia, who had a dip around 2003 but has been rising again after 2009. Overall India, along with the other four countries, is consistently increasing the student enrollment ratio.  "

        "In order to account for the difference in GDP of the different countries, I looked at both the total amount of expenditure in education as well as the percent of expenditure in education as a percent of the gross national income. Japan came on top in both of the metrics. From our previous analysis we know that Japan also has consistently been close to 100 percent in gross enrollment rate. When we look at the expenditure in education with the other countries, we can see a correlation between the amount of student enrollment with the level of investment in education. In India, the percent of investment in education jumped between 1995 and 2000. Interestingly, that is the same time period that the GER for India started to increase consistently. From the adjusted savings expenditure graph, we can observe that China had started to increase its expenditure near 1993, which is also the same time that its secondary education GER began to steadily increase. Although there does not seem to be a direct correlation between government expenditure in education and primary student enrollment, there is a definite correlation between government expenditure in education and secondary school student enrollment."
