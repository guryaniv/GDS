My main thought process for this was:\n\n* Passengers with the same surname may not come from the same family (could come from multiple families).\n\n* There may be important non-surname based groups, for example travelling friends, non-married couples etc.  \n\nSo this notebook uses Chris' approach with ticket grouping and compares the results."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"998f70a4c2abf8a5b014ac9962489d826d24201b"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# load the data\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_csv('../input/train.csv',index_col='PassengerId')","execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"trusted":true,"_uuid":"99d346b4d43daed64f5dc639f00c44443f588875"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# select females and masters (boys)\nboy = (df.Name.str.contains('Master')) | ((df.Sex=='male') & (df.Age<13))\nfemale = df.Sex=='female'\nboy_or_female = boy | female\n\n# no. females + boys on ticket\nn_ticket = df[boy_or_female].groupby('Ticket').Survived.count()\n\n# survival rate amongst females + boys on ticket\ntick_surv = df[boy_or_female].groupby('Ticket').Survived.mean()","execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"trusted":true,"_uuid":"cd783255b6e61b4ec4d5070c0219e3dd64cd80e1"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# function to create relevant features for test data\ndef create_features(frame):\n    frame['Boy'] = (frame.Name.str.contains('Master')) | ((frame.Sex=='male') & (frame.Age<13))\n    \n    frame['Female'] = (frame.Sex=='female').astype(int)\n\n    # if ticket exists in training data, fill NTicket with no. women+boys\n    # on that ticket in the training data.\n    frame['NTicket'] = frame.Ticket.replace(n_ticket)\n    # otherwise NTicket=0\n    frame.loc[~frame.Ticket.isin(n_ticket.index),'NTicket']=0\n\n    # if ticket exists in training data, fill TicketSurv with\n    # women+boys survival rate in training data  \n    frame['TicketSurv'] = frame.Ticket.replace(tick_surv)\n    # otherwise TicketSurv=0\n    frame.loc[~frame.Ticket.isin(tick_surv.index),'TicketSurv']=0\n\n    # return data frame only including features needed for prediction\n    return frame[['Female','Boy','NTicket','TicketSurv']]\n","execution_count":3,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"trusted":true,"_uuid":"a1aa85c62c400b494c39d8c7bb44d148f8bb178d"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# predict survival for a passenger\ndef did_survive(row):\n    if row.Female:\n        # predict died if all women+boys on ticket died\n        if (row.NTicket>0) and (row.TicketSurv==0):\n            return 0\n        # predict survived for all other women\n        else:\n            return 1\n        \n    elif row.Boy:\n        # predict survived if all women+boys on ticket survived\n        if (row.NTicket>0) and (row.TicketSurv==1):\n            return 1\n        # predict died for all other boys\n        else:\n            return 0\n        \n    else:\n        # predict all men die\n        return 0","execution_count":4,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"09451aac9184ee58b4bf8aefc908a9d18a32605e","collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# load test data\ndf_test = pd.read_csv('../input/test.csv',index_col='PassengerId')\n\n# extract the features to use\nX = create_features(df_test)\n\n# predict test data\npred = X.apply(did_survive,axis=1)\n\n# create submission file\npred = pd.DataFrame(pred) \npred.rename(columns={0:'Survived'},inplace=True)\npred.to_csv('submission.csv')\n\nprint(pred.Survived.value_counts())","execution_count":6,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"37d319ff8400128bc685fb5f006038e9313d065c"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Results\n\nThis approach gives me a leaderboard score of 0.813 compared to Chris Deotte's score of 0.823, so is marginally worse than the surname based approach.\n\nBy comparing with his output file, I see that I predict three passengers in the test data survive, whilst Chris predicts they die.

They may be unrelated, but are likely to be travelling cousins/similar who bought tickets separately.\n\nIn summary, whilst I was hoping grouping by ticket would catch a greater variety of groups I'd missed the point that groups of friends etc. are very likely to have bought tickets separately. So only grouping by ticket appears to miss a few relationships, rather than catch more. Also, as the additional rules (vs. a gender only prediction) only apply to groups of women and boys who either all survive or die, there are not so many examples and cases of unrelated families having the same surname are unlikely."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.5","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
