Finding footage of a crime caught on tape is an investigator's dream. But even
with crystal clear, damning evidence, one critical question always remainsâ€“is
the footage real? Today, one way to help authenticate footage is to identify
the camera that the image was taken with. Forgeries often require splicing
together content from two different cameras. But, unfortunately, the most
common way to do this now is using image metadata, which can be easily
falsified itself. This problem is actively studied by several researchers
around the world. Many machine learning solutions have been proposed in the
past: least-squares estimates of a camera's color demosaicing filters as
classification features, co-occurrences of pixel value prediction errors as
features that are passed to sophisticated ensemble classifiers, and using CNNs
to learn camera model identification features. However, this is a problem yet
to be sufficiently solved. For this competition, the IEEE Signal Processing
Society is challenging you to build an algorithm that identifies which camera
model captured an image by using traces intrinsically left in the image.
Helping to solve this problem would have a big impact on the verification of
evidence used in criminal and civil trials and even news reporting.
