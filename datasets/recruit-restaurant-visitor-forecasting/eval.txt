Submissions are evaluated on the root mean squared logarithmic error. The
RMSLE is calculated as 1 n ∑ i=1 n (log( p i +1)−log( a i +1) ) 2 − − − − − −
− − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − √ , where: n is the total number of
observations p i is your prediction of visitors a i is the actual number of
visitors log(x) is the natural logarithm of x Submission File For every store
and date combination in the test set, submission files should contain two
columns: id and visitors. The id is formed by concatenating the air_store_id
and visit_date with an underscore. The file should contain a header and have
the following format: id,visitors air_00a91d42b08b08d9_2017-04-23,0
air_00a91d42b08b08d9_2017-04-24,0 air_00a91d42b08b08d9_2017-04-25,0 etc.
