The proliferation of satellite imagery has given us a radically improved
understanding of our planet. It has enabled us to better achieve everything
from mobilizing resources during disasters to monitoring effects of global
warming. What is often taken for granted is that advancements such as these
have relied on labeling features of significance like building footprints and
roadways fully by hand or through imperfect semi-automated methods. As these
large, complex datasets continue to increase exponentially in number, the
Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) is seeking novel solutions to
alleviate the burden on their image analysts. In this competition, Kagglers
are challenged to accurately classify features in overhead imagery. Automating
feature labeling will not only help Dstl make smart decisions more quickly
around the defense and security of the UK, but also bring innovation to
computer vision methodologies applied to satellite imagery.
