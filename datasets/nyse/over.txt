Context This dataset is a playground for fundamental and technical analysis.
It is said that 30% of traffic on stocks is already generated by machines, can
trading be fully automated? If not, there is still a lot to learn from
historical data. Content Dataset consists of following files: prices.csv: raw,
as-is daily prices. Most of data spans from 2010 to the end 2016, for
companies new on stock market date range is shorter. There have been approx.
140 stock splits in that time, this set doesn't account for that. prices-
split-adjusted.csv: same as prices, but there have been added adjustments for
splits. securities.csv: general description of each company with division on
sectors fundamentals.csv: metrics extracted from annual SEC 10K fillings
(2012-2016), should be enough to derive most of popular fundamental
indicators. Acknowledgements Prices were fetched from Yahoo Finance,
fundamentals are from Nasdaq Financials, extended by some fields from EDGAR
SEC databases. Inspiration Here is couple of things one could try out with
this data: One day ahead prediction: Rolling Linear Regression, ARIMA, Neural
Networks, LSTM Momentum/Mean-Reversion Strategies Security clustering,
portfolio construction/hedging Which company has biggest chance of being
bankrupt? Which one is undervalued (how prices behaved afterwards), what is
Return on Investment?
