The CareerVillage.org analytics competition\n\nCareerVillage.org is a nonprofit that crowdsources career advice for underserved youth. Founded in 2011 in four classrooms in New York City, the platform has now served career advice from 25,000 volunteer professionals to over 3.5M online learners. The platform uses a Q&A style similar to StackOverflow or Quora to provide students with answers to any question about any career.\n\nIn this Data Science for Good challenge, CareerVillage.org, in partnership with Google.org, is inviting you to help recommend questions to appropriate volunteers. To support this challenge, CareerVillage.org has supplied five years of data.\n\n**Problem Statement**\nThe U.S. has almost 500 students for every guidance counselor. Underserved youth lack the network to find their career role models, making CareerVillage.org the only option for millions of young people in America and around the globe with nowhere else to turn.\n\nTo date, 25,000 volunteers have created profiles and opted in to receive emails when a career question is a good fit for them. This is where your skills come in. To help students get the advice they need, the team at CareerVillage.org needs to be able to send the right questions to the right volunteers. The notifications sent to volunteers seem to have the greatest impact on how many questions are answered.\n\nYour objective: develop a method to recommend relevant questions to the professionals who are most likely to answer them."},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"_uuid":"67f48479946bdba619c5560a385d1e29b89a5dde","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport warnings\nwarnings.simplefilter(action='ignore', category=FutureWarning)\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nsns.set()\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport matplotlib as mpl\nimport os","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_kg_hide-input":true,"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(os.listdir(\"../input\"))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"2eb19adb8d93c1cd76fe817e0e5203d6b995e6c2"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"CareerVillage.org has provided several years of anonymized data and each file comes from a table in their database.\n\n* answers.csv: Answers are what this is all about! Answers get posted in response to questions. Answers can only be posted by users who are registered as Professionals. However, if someone has changed their registration type after joining, they may show up as the author of an Answer even if they are no longer a Professional.\n* comments.csv: Comments can be made on Answers or Questions. We refer to whichever the comment is posted to as the \"parent\" of that comment. Comments can be posted by any type of user. Our favorite comments tend to have \"Thank you\" in them :)\n* emails.csv: Each email corresponds to one specific email to one specific recipient. The frequency_level refers to the type of email template which includes immediate emails sent right after a question is asked, daily digests, and weekly digests.\n* group_memberships.csv: Any type of user can join any group. There are only a handful of groups so far.\n* groups.csv: Each group has a \"type\". For privacy reasons we have to leave the group names off.\n* matches.csv: Each row tells you which questions were included in emails. If an email contains only one question, that email's ID will show up here only once. If an email contains 10 questions, that email's ID would show up here 10 times.\n* professionals.csv: We call our volunteers \"Professionals\", but we might as well call them Superheroes. They're the grown ups who volunteer their time to answer questions on the site.\n* questions.csv: Questions get posted by students. Sometimes they're very advanced. Sometimes they're just getting started. It's all fair game, as long as it's relevant to the student's future professional success.\n* school_memberships.csv: Just like group_memberships, but for schools instead.\n* students.csv: Students are the most important people on CareerVillage.org. They tend to range in age from about 14 to 24. They're all over the world, and they're the reason we exist!\n* tag_questions.csv: Every question can be hashtagged. We track the hashtag-to-question pairings, and put them into this file.\n* tag_users.csv: Users of any type can follow a hashtag.
