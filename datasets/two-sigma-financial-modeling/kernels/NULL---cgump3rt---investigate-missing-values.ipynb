But what it is interesting to me is the fact that the standard deviation varies quite a bit. For fundamental and derived data the variations among different IDs seem to be (in general) larger than for the technical feature columns. One reason could be that fundamental data could be missing for fixed number of time stamps (e.g. the first N occurences) which would lead to large variations since time spans for which different IDs are present vary quite a bit as other participants already revealed. In order to test this, we can make the same plot for the absolute number of missing values per feature column."
