Another year, another chance to predict the upsets, call the probabilities,
and put your bracketology skills to the leaderboard test. In our fourth annual
March Machine Learning Mania competition, Kagglers will once again join the
millions of fans who attempt to predict the outcomes of this year's US men's
college basketball tournament. But unlike most fans, you will pick the winners
and losers using a combination of rich historical data and computing power,
while the ground truth unfolds on national television. In the first stage of
the competition, Kagglers will rely on results of past tournaments to build
and test models. We encourage you to post any useful external data as a
dataset. In the second stage, competitors will forecast outcomes of all
possible match-ups in the 2017 tournament. You don't need to participate in
the first stage to enter the second. The first stage exists to incentivize
model building and provide a means to score predictions. The real competition
is forecasting the 2017 results.
