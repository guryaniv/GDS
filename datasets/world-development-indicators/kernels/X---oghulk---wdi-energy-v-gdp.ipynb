It uses the World Development Indicators database from the World Bank in order to explore energy use and how it relates to various development indicators such as GDP, Value Added, and etc. After exploring the data with a group of visualizations, it also conducts simple linear regressions on a few correlations.\n\nThis first section imports a number of the necessary packages to conduct rudimentary data analysis. Numpy is used to operate linear algebra algorithms and equations, Pandas is used for data processing and creating data frames that are used to transform the SQL database we'll be using to make work easier. Sqlite3 is used purely to make the connection in the first section, from there on we use Pandas. Finally, scipy.stats is the package necessary to do simple linear regressions. Scipy is built off Numpy and, although Numpy contains its own linear regression operation, I prefer using scipy.stats. Matplotlib.pyplot is our visualization tool.

In total, the indicators are: energy use, total population, gross domestic product, industry value added, gross capital formation, gross fixed capital formation, and household final consumption. All money accounts are in constant 2005 USD. Population is straight forward and not inflated. Energy use is in kilograms of oil equivalent.\n\nEach piece of code is run from the pandas package and uses a method to read from the SQL database.

First this code merges the values from nrg(energy use) and pop(total population) in order to generate a number for the total actual energy use rather than the energy use per capita. Then the code drops the values linked to the country codes listed above in the list of names. This is because those codes correspond to regional or world values that basically causes a double count in the data; it seems prudent to remove this data in order to have a more accurate representation of the data and not double count.\n\nNext we have a method called model that takes in two data frames, assuming that one will be the energy data frame. The method merges the two data frames on the CountryCode and Year columns in order to make sure the data aligns correctly between the values: since the read_sql code above creates its own index starting from 0, the data in different SQL reads will not necessarily correspond to one another. After merging, the code drops those columns to make the linear regression more easy to digest. It then drops any NaN rows -- not doing so results in another error -- and then takes the logarithm of both values in order to make the data appear linear rather than exponential as it actually is (and so that we can compare between different countries that may have values powers greater than other countries.\n\nWe use the scipy.stats linear regression method, linregress, particularly because I find it easier to use than Numpy's code. We show a scatter plot of the original data, and then plot into that graph the linear regression line using the results from the scipy.stats regression model.

Furthermore, the model I built recognizes a better correlation between final consumption expenditures and energy use than between capital formation (or investments) or manufacturing value added (a commonly noted energy-intensive sector of the economy). \n\nAny comments would be greatly appreciated to make my next project much better.
