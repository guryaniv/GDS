Are there any 'sensitive' roads on the path of a given taxi which may cause a longer trip time? These and more questions can be addressed by a network analysis. \n\nThis notebook uses graph data from this dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/crailtap/street-network-of-new-york-in-graphml , specific it makes use of the Manhattan subgraph, because computation times on the full graph would be to long for Kaggle Kernels. \n\nAlso i would like to encourage you to check out the awesome OSMNX package: https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx\nfrom which i extracted the dataset and from which i make use of some functions. It is not available on Kaggle because it needs a Internet connection to download the graphs.\n\nThe rest of the notebook is structured as follows: First we take a look at some basic properties of the network, like how big is the network and start digging deeper to explore the generative process of the network and which roads may be important in a sense of high traffic volume and under the aspect of road closures aka attacks. Finally we will calculate useful features for the competition, like shortest paths and which boroughs it passes.\n\n", "outputs": [], "metadata": {"_cell_guid": "c440300c-50eb-4101-9af5-1403063368b5", "_uuid": "d4246b380b3816fad755c24de74ab7e5e4b93710", "_execution_state": "idle"}}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "execution_count": null, "source": "#First look at the Network", "outputs": [], "metadata": {"_cell_guid": "3688d45c-912d-4122-94d8-f6730fcdc553", "_uuid": "965ba2fd2b3f72ba4a134161d6b93f4622a249ea", "_execution_state": "idle"}}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "execution_count": null, "source": "In this section we will have a first look at the network (or you can call it graph) and the basic properties of it.

Maybe it is time to introduce some terminology here:\n\nA graph **G = (V, E)**  consists of a set of **nodes** V ( or vertices, points)  and a set of **edges**  E ( links, lines) which can be directed or undirected. The number of nodes  is often called the **size** of the network and   states the number of objects in the model.

Because our Network is the Manhattan Street Network and one property of it is that it contains one-way streets which can only be modeled as directed edges. Because we represent the edges as directed each 'normal' street is now also modeled as a directed edge which means we need to introduce two edges for each normal street, one for each direction of the street.\n\n This property is the reason why we have a **In-degree** and a **Out-degree**, simply measuring how many edges are leaving a node and how many edges are coming in. On average the In-degree is *2.17*and the out-degree is also *2.17*. Average In-degree and Out-degree are always the same, but the distribution of the individual degrees can vary.\n\nGiven the number of nodes and edges one can ask, what is the structure of the network and how does it look like?\nA first measure of the structure of a network is the so called **density** which measure how many links from all possible links within the network are realized.

First of all, deleting nodes which play an important role in the network leads to a faster shrinkage of the giant component than just deleting nodes by random! But only at a given percentage level! At the beginning it doesn't matter if the nodes are picked at random or by their importance, this indicates the robustness of the network. However, at a point there about 10 percent of the nodes are removed deleting specific important nodes lead to a much faster reduction in the giants component size. So these nodes must play an important role in combining the nodes of the network!\n\nInterestingly after only deleting about 50% of the nodes the size of the giant component rapidly reaches a size of almost zero nodes. \n\nWould the network be more robust if the network would contain hubs?
