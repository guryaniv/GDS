Google Cloud and NCAA® have teamed up to bring you this year’s version of the
Kaggle machine learning competition. Another year, another chance to
anticipate the upsets, call the probabilities, and put your bracketology
skills to the leaderboard test. Kagglers will join the millions of fans who
attempt to forecast the outcomes of March Madness® during this year's NCAA
Division I Men’s and Women’s Basketball Championships. But unlike most fans,
you will pick your bracket using a combination of NCAA’s historical data and
your computing power, while the ground truth unfolds on national television.
In the first stage of the competition, Kagglers will rely on results of past
tournaments to build and test models. We encourage you to post any useful
external data as a dataset. In the second stage, competitors will forecast
outcomes of all possible match-ups in the 2018 NCAA Division I Men’s and
Women’s Basketball Championships. You don't need to participate in the first
stage to enter the second. The first stage exists to incentivize model
building and provide a means to score predictions. The real competition is
forecasting the 2018 results. This page is for the NCAA Division I Women's
tournament. Check out the NCAA Division I Men's tournament here.
