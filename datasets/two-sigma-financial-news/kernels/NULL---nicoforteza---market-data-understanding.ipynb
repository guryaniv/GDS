However, the number of available companies at any point in time seems to be market dependant. Even if the number of total assets is 3511, there must be an algorithm that pre-selects the universe, converting it into the investment universe. I can only think in 3 reasons why this may be happening:\n* [Survivorship bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias): Stocks usually trade on a market but are part of an index/market reference/benchmark. There are ins and outs of an index due to market capitalization requirements and M&A events. Therefore, the number of available stocks may change over time. \n* Data filtering: Some filtering algorithm may be run before creating the investment universe. Think of a stituation in which we had no price for a specific security in the past week. What quantitate algorithm is going accept NaN values? The price time series may have been involved in a, let's say, data quality test.\n* Market movements: Looking to the previous picture, there's a [big drop round the second part of 2015, specifically around August](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015%E2%80%9316_stock_market_selloff). The thing is, another filtering algorithm regarding the methodology of the quantitative team may have been applied in the whole dataset to avoid exposure to downside asset movements.

When a company is delivering dividends, the price of the serie falls in the same amoun of the declared dividend since the price series has that information in the price value. Moreover, when companies want to increase their capital, they do splits. This is, they increment/decrease the number of shares without altering their market capitalization, so their price decrease/increase proportionally to mantain that market cap value.
