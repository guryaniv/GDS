With my heart racing and limbs frozen, I surveyed the floor littered with crumpled scraps of paper. How am I ever going sort through this disarray? Just as my mind was smoothly transitioning from sudden shock to sheer hopelesness, a distant memory occured to me. Many a years ago, I learned an ink-enchanting spell. If I can just channel the spirits of those three frightening wordsmiths into the physical words on these pages, perhaps they will reveal some hint to who authored each sentence. I focus my mind, and slowly, word by word, spell out the incantation. As I am finishing the last syllable of the last spell, the letters on the pages come alive with a soft glow. I lean to look closer, only to be startled by a sudden flurry of motion and bright colorful flashes. Once the excitement settled down, I could see that the text transformed, and each word took on its own hue and magnitude.
