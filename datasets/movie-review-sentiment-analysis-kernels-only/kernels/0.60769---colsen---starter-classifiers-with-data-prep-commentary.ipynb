We can do this by creating variables based on what words and phrases appear in the text. \n\nWe can feed that that into *sklearn*'s TfidfVectorizer to come up with something that's a bit more nuanced than a normal document term matrix, which would be a binary 1/0 for whether each document contains each ngram (see [dtm Wikipedia explanation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document-term_matrix) for more details). The tfidf is goes a bit further by assigning weights (rather than a binary 1/0) based on how important the word is to the document, with respect to the corpus. Downweighting more common words and upweighting less common words lets us come up with a final matrix that better differentiates betwen documents. \n\nTfidVectorizer determines these weights by:\n1. Getting term frequency (tf): How many times does a word (or ngram) appear in a single document? For example, the word \"the\" is very common and will appear with high frequency in most documents -- and does not provide much information, so we will ultimately want to reduce the weight placed on \"the.\" \n2. Getting inverse document frequency (idf): How many documents are in your corpus, divided by the number of documents containing the word (or ngram)? Then take the log of the result. If the word \"the\" appears in 100 documents in a corpus of 100 documents, its idf value will be log(100/100) = 0. If a word only appears in one of those documents, its idf value will be log(100/1) = 2.\n3. To calculate the final weight for the word or ngram, multiply tf by idf. For example, if the word \"the\" appeared in 100 documents and had an idf value of 0, the tfidf value would be 100x0 = 0 -- so it will count for no weight at all because it appears in all documents and is not useful to differentiate between them.
