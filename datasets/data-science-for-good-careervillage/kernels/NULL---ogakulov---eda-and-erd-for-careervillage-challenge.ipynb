Hope you find it useful.\n\nLet's start by examining the organization. [CareerVillage.com](https://www.careervillage.org/) is a platform for *students* to ask *questions* related to career and for *professionals* to *answer* these questions. There can be multiple answers per question, as professionals can differ in opinion or they can build on previous answers. Questions can also be *tagged* (e.g. #technology #computer-science), which I guess is what CareerVillage currently uses to *match* questions to specific professionals on their *email* distribution list. Finally, we know a bit about the users:\n* For professionals we have location (city, state), industry, headline, and date they joined the platform\n* For students we know location, school membership, group membership\n\nNote also that user profiles can also be *tagged* for both professionals and students, similarly both types of users can be part of *groups*. This is not captured in the entity relationship diagram below."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d3a8b98752ef76ec757f924311143da738e46ada"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":" ![DB Image](https://i.ibb.co/2PDK5ws/download.png)"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"4a487ab4add11fdd178dfb622e0afa6c70ffd94d"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's look at the central topic of the challenge - the **questions** that students ask. We have close to 24,000 questions asked in the span of 8 years. The challenge didn't make it clear wheather this is a sampling of questions or the complete set, but what I think will be important is how (if at all) do the questions change over time. In the meantime, here's how the volume of questions breaks down by year. You can see when the platform gained popularity, in 2016 there were over 9,000 questions asked. There is a strange dip in 2017 which I can't yet explain, and of course year 2019 has just begun.
