However, these authors all wrote works with similar themes in English in the 1800s and (for Lovecraft) early 1900s. It may simply be that many of the topics that we've found appear in the works of all three. It also may be that the texts are simply too short to get a good encoding of the topic. So, are there any better ways to analyze our data?\n", "\n", "# Naive Bayes Classification\n", "\n", "A naive Bayes classifier might do much better here.

The CountVectorizer in Scikit-learn is an easy way to generate a Scikit-learn-friendly term frequency matrix. We can also choose the range of n-grams to use and the minimum document frequency. I'll just set some numbers here. I'm still using the text after removing stop words and running the stemming algorithm, so it's likely that things like 3-grams are usually unique to a single document.
