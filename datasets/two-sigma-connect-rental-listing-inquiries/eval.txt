Submissions are evaluated using the multi-class logarithmic loss. Each listing
has one true class. For each listing, you must submit a set of predicted
probabilities (one for every listing). The formula is then, logloss=− 1 N ∑
i=1 N ∑ j=1 M y ij log( p ij ), where N is the number of listings in the test
set, M is the number of class labels (3 classes), log is the natural
logarithm, y ij is 1 if observation i belongs to class j and 0 otherwise, and
p ij is the predicted probability that observation i belongs to class j . The
submitted probabilities for a given listing are not required to sum to one
because they are rescaled prior to being scored (each row is divided by the
row sum). In order to avoid the extremes of the log function, predicted
probabilities are replaced with max(min(p,1− 10 −15 ), 10 −15 ) . Submission
File You must submit a csv file with the listing_id, and a probability for
each class. The order of the rows does not matter. The file must have a header
and should look like the following: listing_id,high,medium,low
