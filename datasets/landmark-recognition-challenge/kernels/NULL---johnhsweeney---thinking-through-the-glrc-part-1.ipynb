I can think of 4 different reasons why I would want to do this - and each one would dictate a different approach\n\n#### Academic\n\nIf I take this as an academic problem, then I would probably just focus on the computer vision aspects.  Can I find novel new algorithms, network structures, or clever reuse of solutions created for different (but similar) problems.  I would focus on the idea more than the absolute performance.  A good idea, even if it isn't fully developed, is better than a brute force solution.  YOLO when it was first introduced wasn't the most accurate solution available for Object Detection.  It was much faster than most, but not most accurate.  However, with further development, it was better and faster than other approaches.\n\n#### Production\n\nIf I think of this as a real problem to be solved with the solution to be deployed as a product, I would have very different concerns and constraints than if it were simply an academic exercise.  I would set goals for accuracy, speed of execution, computational cost, etc. and I would measure my solution against them.  I would accept a solution that is \"good enough\" to satisfy my customers at a cost I can afford.  The nature of a software product or service is that you can always improve it over time.\n\n#### Competition\n\nThis is, obviously, the approach kaggle wants us to take.  It is a competition.  That means optimizing the scoring metric is all that matters.  Beautiful, clever solution - nice to have, but if a massive brute force approach gets a better score use it!  Spend 5 times the computational cost to create an enseble model that will result in a preformance gain of a few percent - do it!  Time and compute resources available are your only real limitations!\n\n#### Forensic\n\nThis is an interesting use case that I hadn't considered initially.  Think of a state actor (law enforcement, security services, military, etc.) that has obtained an image of an interesting subject (i.e. two people talking on the street of some city).  They want to know where this happened, to hope to take the next step in an investigation.  I think this drives behaviour most like the competition approach above.  The value of that piece of information may be large enough to justify extreme solutions.\n\n#### So...\n\nI'm sure I'm starting to bore you, so I'll wrap up the philosophy class and get to some code!!!\n\nIt turns out than I'm not an academic, I don't expect to win this competition, and I've never worked for a spy agency.  I think I'll approach this as though it was something I would deploy as a product (service) if I ran a large social media photo sharing operation"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"acba4c7e184c5e6d751270f5167ece8d2bd201d8"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Step 2 - Let's look at the data\n\nBefore we make any decisions on implementation plans, let just spend some time poking around...\n\nI started at home using the excellent script provided by Anokas to download the test and train data https://www.kaggle.com/anokas/python3-dataset-downloader-with-progress-bar\n\nHowever, you need to be able to see some results in this kernel, so I'll use what I learned offline to show you some things online..."},{"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"trusted":true,"_uuid":"d64672c536e7a4d6e68c4e4b25226c5a2c52bb47"},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nfrom IPython.display import Image\nfrom IPython.core.display import HTML \nfrom urllib import request","execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"e6357c7f8a7777cf6e530e4ded400508f183720b"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# read in the list of train and test photos\n\n# Kaggle version\ntrain = pd.read_csv('../input/train.csv')\ntest = pd.read_csv('../input/test.csv')\n\n# Let's make sure that went as expected...

As I mentioned above I did it using Anokas script.  It took a couple of hours to download the test images.  I was able to get 115,493 out of the total 117,703 (~98%).  I let the train images download overnight, so they took 10-12 hours.

Most CNN's use much smaller images.  I resized so that the shorter edge of the image was 256 pixels.\n\nThis greatly reduced the storage space required:\n\n    Resized Test - 2.5GB\n    Resized Train - 25GB\n\nI'll share the code I used for the resizing in post later this week\n\nLooking at the original dimensions of the test images, none have a short side dimension less than 160px\n\nOn the other hand, in the training data, there are >15,000 with a short side dimension less than 160px.
