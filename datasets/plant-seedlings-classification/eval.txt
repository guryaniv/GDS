Submissions are evaluated on MeanFScore, which at Kaggle is actually a micro-
averaged F1-score. Given positive/negative rates for each class k, the
resulting score is computed this way: Precisio n micro = ∑ k∈C T P k ∑ k∈C T P
k +F P k Recal l micro = ∑ k∈C T P k ∑ k∈C T P k +F N k F1-score is the
harmonic mean of precision and recall MeanFScore=F 1 micro = 2Precisio n micro

eachfile in the test set, you must predict a probability for the species
variable. The file should contain a header and have the following format:
