Submissions are evaluated on Mean Absolute Error between the predicted log
error and the actual log error. The log error is defined as
logerror=log(Zestimate)−log(SalePrice) logerror=log(Zestimate)−log(SalePrice)
and it is recorded in the transactions training data. If a transaction didn't
happen for a property during that period of time, that row is ignored and not
counted in the calculation of MAE. Submission File For each property (unique
parcelid), you must predict a log error for each time point. You should be
predicting 6 timepoints: October 2016 (201610), November 2016 (201611),
December 2016 (201612), October 2017 (201710), November 2017 (201711), and
December 2017 (201712). The file should contain a header and have the
following format: ParcelId,201610,201611,201612,201710,201711,201712
10754147,0.1234,1.2234,-1.3012,1.4012,0.8642-3.1412 10759547,0,0,0,0,0,0 etc.
Note that the actual log errors are accurate the 4th decimal places, so you
can adjust your decimal formats to limit the size of your submission file.
