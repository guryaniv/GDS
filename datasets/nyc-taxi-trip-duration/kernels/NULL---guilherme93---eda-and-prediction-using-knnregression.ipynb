That indicated the usual overfitting behavior we get from too few neighbors. Both errors tend to meet at around 0.4, which is a relatively good error for such a simple model.\n\n## Final Considerations\n\nThis model is very simplistic, and there are many things that can be done to improve it. For example, we could use weather data to figure out if on a specific day/hour it rained/snowed heavy. That certainly influences trip durations. Also, hour and week are cyclical measures. That means that 23 hours is closer to 0 hours than to 20 hours. Same thing goes for week ( Sunday is closer to Monday than it is to Friday). But this behavior is not captured on the chosen model. A nice and elegant way to incorporate such cyclical behavior would be to use sine/cosine features, as explained on this thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/203pqk/machine_learning_and_comparing_times/?st=jhgziikz&sh=d21d3e70.\n\nThank you for reading and I'm open to feedbacks and critiques!"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"9ea6c42539ec14b7f365ef075da6cb69a9f7f660"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"dceb805574affff708e620fbe8b308794ef1af28"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"296624aed611371fbc0ddad98412f07a6cf9f225"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"b55c56edabf2a02aac996ee3c01f5a31082b1c2c"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"04496d5770f8ba3b6426c734680eb4cf73e23c06"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"d4325c8342bf37e6650cd87a1375ba050b6ee1b6"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"617c05680dbebd7647377dda65d230be2a79e527"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"9734d5191e19281ab47926b63e25be22f775c841"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"3059bd3481a99375ba2286627668e0d935335c94"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"b358423bd3ccc0593a5b8d6567c2204896c3b732"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"33064e0f26212219f5f0b7f92859ba4642a1dada"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"0f18764aa80e7c47ecdaac1166317243347775c0"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"5441d8480271c976535dcee84062de1997000077"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"483c01019db7e432d3035b1bada54c77b315062c"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"9905549ed1e4debde47eb60a2402388b14aaba1c"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.5","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
