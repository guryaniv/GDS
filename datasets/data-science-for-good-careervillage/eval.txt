Evaluation Your objective is to develop a method for recommending career
advice questions to relevant volunteers that are most likely to answer them. A
valid submission will include: Kernel Notebook: At least one kernel containing
your method that recommends questions to volunteers. All kernels submitted
must be made public on or before the submission deadline to be eligible. If
submitting as a team, all team members must be listed as collaborators on all
kernels submitted. Criteria for Measuring Solutions Performance: How well does
the solution match questions to volunteers that would be most likely to
answer? CareerVillage.org will not be able to live-test every submission, so a
strong entry will clearly articulate why it is effective. Easy to implement:
The CareerVillage.org team wants to put the winning submissions to work
quickly. A good entry will be well documented and easy to test in production.
Extensibility: In the future, CareerVillage.org aims to add more data
features. The best submissions will make it easy to add new features and data
not presently available.
