In game, players can pick up different munitions, revive downed-but-not-out (knocked) teammates, drive vehicles, swim, run, shoot, and experience all of the consequences -- such as falling too far or running themselves over and eliminating themselves.\n\nYou are provided with a large number of anonymized PUBG game stats, formatted so that each row contains one player's post-game stats. The data comes from matches of all types: solos, duos, squads, and custom; there is no guarantee of there being 100 players per match, nor at most 4 player per group.\n\nYou must create a model which predicts players' finishing placement based on their final stats, on a scale from 1 (first place) to 0 (last place)."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"162fe20008ab4f6b07522cb4ebe75b419cc803ce"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**data dictionary**\n\n**DBNOs** - Number of enemy players knocked.\n\n**assists** - Number of enemy players this player damaged that were killed by teammates.\n\n**boosts** - Number of boost items used.\n\n**damageDealt** - Total damage dealt. Note: Self inflicted damage is subtracted.\n\n**headshotKills** - Number of enemy players killed with headshots.\n\n**heals** - Number of healing items used.\n\n**Id** - Player’s Id\n\n**killPlace** - Ranking in match of number of enemy players killed.\n\n**killPoints** - Kills-based external ranking of player. (Think of this as an Elo ranking where only kills matter.) If there is a value other than -1 in rankPoints, then any 0 in killPoints should be treated as a “None”.\n\n**killStreaks** - Max number of enemy players killed in a short amount of time.\n\n**kills** - Number of enemy players killed.\n\n**longestKill** - Longest distance between player and player killed at time of death. This may be misleading, as downing a player and driving away may lead to a large longestKill stat.\n\n**matchDuration** - Duration of match in seconds.\n\n**matchId** - ID to identify match. There are no matches that are in both the training and testing set.\n\n**matchType** - String identifying the game mode that the data comes from. The standard modes are “solo”, “duo”, “squad”, “solo-fpp”, “duo-fpp”, and “squad-fpp”; other modes are from events or custom matches.\n\n**rankPoints** - Elo-like ranking of player. This ranking is inconsistent and is being deprecated in the API’s next version, so use with caution. Value of -1 takes place of “None”.\n\n**revives** - Number of times this player revived teammates.\n\n**rideDistance** - Total distance traveled in vehicles measured in meters.\n\n**roadKills** - Number of kills while in a vehicle.\n\n**swimDistance** - Total distance traveled by swimming measured in meters.\n\n**teamKills** - Number of times this player killed a teammate.\n\n**vehicleDestroys** - Number of vehicles destroyed.\n\n**walkDistance** - Total distance traveled on foot measured in meters.\n\n**weaponsAcquired** - Number of weapons picked up.\n\n**winPoints** - Win-based external ranking of player. (Think of this as an Elo ranking where only winning matters.) If there is a value other than -1 in rankPoints, then any 0 in winPoints should be treated as a “None”.\n\n**groupId** - ID to identify a group within a match. If the same group of players plays in different matches, they will have a different groupId each time.\n\n**numGroups**  - Number of groups we have data for in the match.\n\n**maxPlace** - Worst placement we have data for in the match. This may not match with numGroups, as sometimes the data skips over placements.\n\n**winPlacePerc** - The target of prediction. This is a percentile winning placement, where 1 corresponds to 1st place, and 0 corresponds to last place in the match. It is calculated off of maxPlace, not numGroups, so it is possible to have missing chunks in a match."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#load libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"a0724d05f214513395bccde920a4b13341a269df"},"cell_type":"code","source":"#load data\ndf_train = pd.read_csv(\"../input/train_V2.csv\")\ndf_test = pd.read_csv(\"../input/test_V2.csv\")\ndf_submission = pd.read_csv(\"../input/sample_submission_V2.csv\")\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"a59bb2821d765722d17eb4b26d3afe4f39d36826"},"cell_type":"code","source":"training_average_placement = df_train['winPlacePerc'].mean()\nsubmission = pd.read_csv('../input/sample_submission_V2.csv')\nsubmission['winPlacePerc'] = training_average_placement\nprint(submission.head())","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
