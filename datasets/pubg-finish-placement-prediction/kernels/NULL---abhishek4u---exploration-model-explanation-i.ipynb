(Think of this as an Elo ranking where only kills matter.)\n\nkillStreaks - Max number of enemy players killed in a short amount of time.\n\nkills - Number of enemy players killed.\n\nlongestKill - Longest distance between player and player killed at time of death. This may be misleading, as downing a player and driving \naway may lead to a large longestKill stat.\n\nmatchId - Integer ID to identify match.

This may not match with numGroups, as sometimes the data skips over placements.\n\nwinPlacePerc - The target of prediction. This is a percentile winning placement, where 1 corresponds to 1st place, and 0 corresponds to last place in the match.
