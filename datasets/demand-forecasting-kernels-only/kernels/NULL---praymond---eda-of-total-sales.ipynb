The task is about forecasting sales of 50 different items in a list of 10 stores over a three month period.  My objective was to get hands-on with a data forecast challenge and understand the structure of the data. I wanted to use this challenge as an opportunity to improve my skill with plotting and analyzing data  in Python.\n\nThe main phases of my analysis were as follows:\n\n1.  High Level look at the data\n\n2. Look for structure trends and seasonality in the data (I chose to do it myself rather than use available tools)\n\n3. Compare my effort with what a seasonal decomposition would have done out of the box.\n\nThe main Findings were:\n    *  This data is clean. It feels like synthetic data.\n    *  The sales pattern is similar for every item and store.\n    *  There is  year over year growth in sales volume for which I did not find a clear pattern.\n    *  There is a repeated seasonal pattern every year.\n    *  There is a repeated weekly pattern.\n    *  Within a month, variations are mostly linked to Day-Of-Week.\n    * The level of sales for a specific day is linked to number of days in a month.\n\nThe material is organized as a diary. It reads sequentially. It sometimes runs down a path and backtracks when the data shows something that I had not foreseen.\n\nIt concludes with an analysis of the training that reduces it to a random noise (though not quite white)."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"b56026de8aeafacd4890a06865c2df5eda242f59"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1.

It looks like there is a monthly pattern.\nEvery other month (except month 7 and 8)  are alternatingly high and low. And month 2 is pretty low. \n![](http://)***The immediate thought is that this correlates to the number of days in a month !!!!\n\nI can't think of a rational reason for this, but we will now adjust the data for the number of days in a month and look at the residual again.\n\n***Surprise 2:\nthe difference grows over the year.... it looks like we were too ambitious thinking growth would be a day to day trend. It looks like growth might really just happens at the end of the year, and we are looking for a single factor every year.\n\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"243bb4736e07f009e4515d27d16f1392ae450892"},"cell_type":"code","source":"import calendar\n\ndef DiM(MyDate) :\n    MyYear = MyDate.year \n    MyMonth = MyDate.month\n    return calendar.monthrange(MyYear,MyMonth)[1]\n\nGroupedMyTrain['year'] = GroupedMyTrain.date.dt.year\nGroupedMyTrain['month'] = GroupedMyTrain.date.dt.month\nGroupedMyTrain['DayInMonth'] = GroupedMyTrain.date.map(lambda x: DiM(x))\nGroupedMyTrain['DiMFactor']  = 31 / GroupedMyTrain['DayInMonth'] \n\n\nGeomFactor2 = GroupedMyTrain.groupby('year').sum()['sales']\nGeomFactor2 =  GeomFactor2/GeomFactor2[2013]\n\nGroupedMyTrain['GeomFactor2'] = GroupedMyTrain.year.map(lambda x: GeomFactor2[x])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"4f440f43767a529ae9ea727f64778a94f6e0f946"},"cell_type":"code","source":"RefVal = GroupedMyTrain.sales[0] / GroupedMyTrain['DoWFactor'][0] /GroupedMyTrain['MonthFactor'][0]\nGroupedMyTrain['Predicted'] =       \\\n    RefVal                        * \\\n    GroupedMyTrain['DoWFactor']   * \\\n    GroupedMyTrain['MonthFactor'] * \\\n    GroupedMyTrain['GeomFactor2'] * \\\n    GroupedMyTrain['DiMFactor']","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"202fe1b902896aa9e3ffa6e9ea69883dfed10533"},"cell_type":"code","source":"GroupedMyTrain['Delta'] = GroupedMyTrain['Predicted'] - GroupedMyTrain['sales']\nGroupedMyTrain.plot(x='date',y='Delta',figsize=(20,5),marker='.',markersize=2,ls=' ')\n\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"85c40e48b1b88e64a066713bfe5062bcdeb068ac"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"So DayInMonth Factor was pretty good at removing variations from month to month.\n\nThis is really surprising.
