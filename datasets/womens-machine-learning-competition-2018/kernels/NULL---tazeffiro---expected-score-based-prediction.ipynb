My final predicitons were created by combining this the Glicko score and variance of each team, and other details available from  WNCAATourneyCompactResults.csv\n\n**THEORY OF OPERATION**\n\nIn a given basketball game, a team1 scores a given number of points, though offense, and prevents a number of points, though defense. The same goes for team2. \n\nLet O1 be the offence of team1, O2 be the offense of team2, D1 be the defense of team1, and D2 be the defense of team2. All of these are random variables in units of points. \n\nAs a result if O1 - D2 > O2 - D1 then team1 should be expected to win. As such let us define another variable *L*\n\nlet *L* = O1 + D1 - O2 - D2 \n\nThus P(*L* > 0) = P(team1 wins) and P(*L* < 0) = P(team2 wins)\n\nNow to find a suitable measure of offense and defense.\nI made the assumtions that over the course of a season a given teams opponents would be representative of that of the entire league, and that transitivity holds i.e. if team1 is likely to beat team2 and team2 is likely to beat team3 then team1 is likely to beat team3, likely referring to being expected to beat 50% of the time.\n\nAs such I chose O1 to be the average number of points scored in a game by team1, and D1 the negative average score of the opponent to team1 in a game. As it turned out the both of these random variables appeared to be roughly normally distributed, thus with some simple statistics a description for *L* becomes easy. However, in principle any distribution should work with the appropriate math.\n\nE(*L*) = E(O1) + E(D1) - E(O2) - E(D2) \n\nand \n\nvar(*L*) = var(O1) + var(D1) + var(O2) + var(D2) \n\n**NOTE:**Tthe code below is to make the implementation later easier to read\n"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":false,"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_kg_hide-input":false,"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","collapsed":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd \nimport numpy as np\nimport math\nimport scipy.stats as st\n\nclass Season():\n    def __init__(self, year):\n        self.year = year\n        seasonResults = pd.read_csv(\"../input/WRegularSeasonCompactResults.csv\")\n        yearMask = seasonResults.loc[:,'Season'] == self.year\n        self.games = seasonResults.loc[yearMask,:].copy()\n        self.__setTeams()\n        self.expectedScore = (self.games.loc[:,\"WScore\"].mean() + self.games.loc[:,\"LScore\"].mean()) / 2\n        self.__calcErrors()\n        \n    def __setTeams(self, filename = \"../input/WNCAATourneySeeds.csv\"):\n        \"\"\"\n        Pulls all of the teams due to compete in the tournement in the coming year\n        \"\"\"\n        temp = pd.read_csv(filename)\n        temp = temp.query('Season == {}'.format(self.year)).copy()\n        teamset = set()\n        teamset.update(temp[\"TeamID\"].unique())\n        self.tournTeams = list(teamset)\n        self.tournTeams.sort()\n        \n        allteamset = set(self.games.loc[:,\"WTeamID\"].unique())\n        allteamset.update(self.games.loc[:,\"LTeamID\"].unique())\n        self.allTeams = list(allteamset)\n        self.allTeams.sort()\n        \n    def __calcErrors(self):\n        scores = self.games.loc[:,\"WScore\"].copy().values\n        scores = np.append(self.games.loc[:,\"LScore\"],scores)\n        scores = np.std(scores)\n        self.stdScore = scores\n        \n    def getTeamRecords(self,teamId):\n        return self.games.query('(WTeamID == {} | LTeamID == {})'.format(teamId,teamId))\nclass Team():\n    def __init__(self, teamId, season):\n        self.teamId = teamId\n        self.record = season.getTeamRecords(self.teamId)\n        self.__setOffense()\n        \n    def play(self, opponent, gameData ):\n        return 0\n        \n    def __str__(self):\n        print(self.teamId)\n        print(\"Team Scoring: \", self.teamStats)\n        print(\"Opponent Scoring: \", self.oppStats)\n        return \"\"\n        \n    def __setOffense(self):\n        Wmask = self.record['WTeamID'] == self.teamId\n        Lmask = self.record['LTeamID'] == self.teamId        \n        \n        teamScoreSeries = pd.Series([])\n        teamScoreSeries = teamScoreSeries.append([self.record[Wmask]['WScore'].copy(),\n                                self.record[Lmask]['LScore'].copy()], ignore_index=True)\n        \n        oppScoreSeries = pd.Series()\n        oppScoreSeries = oppScoreSeries.append([self.record.loc[Wmask,'LScore'].copy(),\n                                                self.record.loc[Lmask,'WScore'].copy()], ignore_index=True)\n        \n        self.teamStats = {\"PPG\":teamScoreSeries.mean(), \"STD\":teamScoreSeries.std()}\n        self.oppStats = {\"PPG\":oppScoreSeries.mean(), \"STD\":oppScoreSeries.std()}\n\nclass Matchup(object):\n    def __init__(self,team1,team2,season):\n        self.season = season.year\n        self.team1 = team1.teamId\n        self.team2 = team2.teamId\n        self.PTeam1Win = EstimateProb(team1,team2)\n        \n    def tostr(self):\n        return \"{}_{}_{},{}\\n\".format(\n                self.season,self.team1,self.team2,self.PTeam1Win)","execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"With the backbone in place we now go to the computational heavy lifting, for each year specified in years we will analyze each teams performance and output a dataframe with all of the features."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"880398d0-607c-4569-ae99-7064f56d1037","_uuid":"de29da41bcb42774739d4074a49f1d6141708f9e","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"years = [1998,1999,2000,2001,2002,2003,2004,2005,2006,2007,2008,2009,2010,2011,2012,2013,2014,2015,2016,2017] #
