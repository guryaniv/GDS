But overall the scale is not so huge and the shape is not quite like the other biggest spikes. So I skipped it for this investigation.\n\n### What relation do the Mktres value represent?\n\nLooking at this data also helped me understand a bit more about what the values in this dataset are. In this case, a DNDO rise from 11.81 to 22.94 from 2009-04-28 to 2009-04-29 gives **returnsClosePrevMktres1** as 1.00, so seems this metric value is showing the % rise. So 1.00 would refer to 100% rise. While 11.81 * 2 is not exactly 22.94, the market adjustment could make up for the small difference. The previous day drop from 21.55 to 11.81 gives **returnsClosePrevRaw1** as -0.46, which could indicate a similar drop of about 46%. It seems so.\n\nHowever, looking at the other data items, it does not seem quite so simple. For example, EVHC on 2016-12-01 has an open value of 22.72 and on the following day an open value of 66.25. But the **returnsOpenPrevRaw1** is only 1.9. And 22.72 * 1.9 = 42.3, which is not quite the value of 66.25. And this is the \"*raw*\" value, so I thought it should not be modified by any market related multiplier? I guess I still don't quite understand the return values.\n\nNo need to add any new values to the outliers collection based on my limited understanding here."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"90a6a394420037b81a4ade4c08d0f6abbffadd60"},"cell_type":"code","source":"#outlier_collection","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"53e0e0b0a19a03dad832e81b766b4bd3aff2d098"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now the similar residualized 1-day open values:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"5f21e3eab4bf226370e8f7ba6e81fa50fe17e1fa"},"cell_type":"code","source":"outliers = mt_df.sort_values('returnsOpenPrevMktres1', ascending=False)[:30]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"5dd9763015d5f48500375791b0bf62a1d9ad03b7","scrolled":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"graph_outliers_grid(True, True, 5)\n#graph_outliers_grid(True, True, 30)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"34dd395b57d32a6a7aa901c28e33511aecec529d"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Again, there are no obvious new spikes here. But when I used *graph_outliers_grid* function to print  the asset data for all the 30 assets visualized above, I found some more data that looks strange to me. ABV has the previously noted outlier on 2008-09-18. The opening price drops from 53.33 to 0.02 and then goes back up to 54.54 the following day. Looking for the market dataset highest values for **returnsOpenPrevMktres1**, ABV actually comes up many times, showing up as multiple charts above. Looking at this for ABV, the single large outlier actually continues to produce high **returnsOpenPrevMktres1** values for several days into the future as a series of 2088, -396, 405, 170, and so on. Yet the daily **open**/**close** changes are small after the single spike. I cannot quite figure out how the daily change is calculated for **returnsOpenPrevMktres1** since a 1-day outlier impact seems to go on for many days and I though 1 referred to single day impact?\n\nOn October 2nd, the **returnsOpenPrevMktres10** for ABV goes up to 2734, indicating the 10-day value is for exactly 10 days in the past. Not something that sums up the past 10 days as I first thought it might be.\n\nABV is not the only one with this behaviour but similarly at least in TEO.N and TX.N show such behaviour. In fact, all these come up multiple times here. For example, TX has an outlier on 2008-08-22, which shows up as value of 3498 for **returnsOpenPrevRaw1**, which is huuuge. The day before that shows the same value as -0.999, indicating a 99.9% drop. However, besides this single day impact, the TX values for **returnsOpenPrevMktres1** still go on at very high levels up to 2008-09-22 and likely further, which is a full month after the one-day spike for a \"1-day return\" value.\n\nThe timeframe for the **returnsOpenPrevRaw10** and **returnsOpenPrevMktres10** for TX shows a high value for 2008-09-08, which seems more than 10 days apart from from 2008-08-22. This is similar to the ABV relation of spike at 2008-09-18 and observing a 10-day effect on Oct. 2nd. So after a whlie of looking at this, I realize the 10 days refers to business/trading days and not calendar days.\n\nI guess all this just summarizes that I don't quite understand the terminology or what the values represent here. Makes it a bit harder to figure what to do with these outliers, and how much data should I drop or replace, and what should I replace it with. Or what good are the value for, huh? :)\n\nTo collect the high ABV values from above.

Is this some general approach every time?\n* The data seems to have some pretty basic issues. How is such basic cleaning not done as to fix these obvious outliers? Is this also on purpose?\n* Where does the data come from? does someone pay for this messy data? How would they not have an automated process in place since long ago to highlight such issues? :)\n* What are the market adjusted values actually? My 1-day and 10-day assumptions did not quite hold. Especially the 1-day ones. What are they adjusted on, and what is the relation to past data?\n* What happened in June 6th, 2016? Somebody had a bad day with the data?\n* Are those outliers all errors and if not, what happened? If they are, what happened.. I would've though market data is collected automatically and not so prone to input errors :)\n\nI initially though it would be useful to clean this data by just dropping the data for an asset for the two days when the spike occurs (up/down). I thought this would get rid of the days with biggest change, and with the biggest change for 1-day metrics that follow. And then for 10-day metrics, maybe it would be smoothed out.
