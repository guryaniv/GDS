Who's a good dog? Who likes ear scratches? Well, it seems those fancy deep
neural networks don't have all the answers. However, maybe they can answer
that ubiquitous question we all ask when meeting a four-legged stranger: what
kind of good pup is that? In this playground competition, you are provided a
strictly canine subset of ImageNet in order to practice fine-grained image
categorization. How well you can tell your Norfolk Terriers from your Norwich
Terriers? With 120 breeds of dogs and a limited number training images per
class, you might find the problem more, err, ruff than you anticipated.
Acknowledgments We extend our gratitude to the creators of the Stanford Dogs
Dataset for making this competition possible: Aditya Khosla, Nityananda
Jayadevaprakash, Bangpeng Yao, and Fei-Fei Li.
