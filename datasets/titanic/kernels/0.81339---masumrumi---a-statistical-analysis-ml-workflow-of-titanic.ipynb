Statistical Test for Correlation\n<a id=\"statistical_test\"></a>\n***\n\nStatistical tests are the scientific way to prove the validation of theories. In any case, when we look at the data, we seem to have an intuitive understanding of where data is leading us. However, when we do statistical tests, we get a scientific or mathematical perspective of how significant these results are. Let's apply some of the trials and see how we are doing with our predictions.\n\n###  Hypothesis Testing Outline\n\nA hypothesis test compares the mean of a control group and experimental group and tries to find out whether the two sample means are different from each other and if they are different, how significant that difference is.\n \nA **hypothesis test** usually consists of multiple parts: \n\n1. Formulate a well-developed research problem or question: The hypothesis test usually starts with a concrete and well-developed researched problem. We need to ask the right question that can be answered using statistical analyses. \n2. The null hypothesis ($H_0$) and Alternating hypothesis($H_1$):\n> * The **null hypothesis($H_0$)** is something that is assumed to be true. It is the status quo. In a null hypothesis, the observations are the result of pure chance. When we set out to experiment, we form the null hypothesis by saying that there is no difference between the means of the control group and the experimental group.\n> *  An **Alternative hypothesis($H_A$)** is a claim and the opposite of the null hypothesis.  It is going against the status quo. In an alternative theory, the observations show a real effect combined with a component of chance variation.\n    \n3. Determine the **test statistic**: test statistic can be used to assess the truth of the null hypothesis. Depending on the standard deviation we either use t-statistics or z-statistics. In addition to that, we want to identify whether the test is a one-tailed test or two-tailed test. \n\n4. Specify a **Significance level**: The significance level($\\alpha$) is the probability of rejecting a null hypothesis when it is true. In other words, we are ***comfortable/confident*** with rejecting the null hypothesis a significant amount of times even though it is true. This considerable amount is our Significant level. In addition to that significance level is one minus our Confidence interval. For example, if we say, our significance level is 5%, then our confidence interval would be (1 - 0.05) = 0.95 or 95%. \n\n5. Compute the **T-statistics**: Computing the t-statistics follows a simple equation. This equation slightly differs depending on one sample test or two sample test  \n\n6. Compute the **P-value**: P-value is the probability that a test statistic at least as significant as the one observed would be obtained assuming that the null hypothesis was correct. The p-value is known to be unintuitive, and even many professors are known to explain it wrong. I think this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4KCfcVwzyw) explains the p-value well. **The smaller the P-value, the stronger the evidence against the null hypothesis.**\n\n7. **Describe the result and compare the p-value with the significance value($\\alpha$)**: If p<= $\\alpha$, then the observed effect is statistically significant, the null hypothesis is ruled out, and the alternative hypothesis is valid. However if the p> $\\alpha$, we say that, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Even though this sentence is grammatically wrong, it is logically right. We never accept the null hypothesis just because we are doing the statistical test with sample data points.\n\nWe will follow each of these steps above to do your hypothesis testing below.\n\n***"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"f3b49278bd1b8eff8fe1b14c1506d73cf53bd859"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Hypothesis testing\n#### Formulating a well developed researched question: \nRegarding this dataset, we can formulate the null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis by asking the following questions. \n> * **Is there a significant difference in the mean sex between the passenger who survived and passenger who did not survive?**. \n> * **Is there a substantial difference in the survival rate between the male and female passengers?**\n#### The Null Hypothesis and The Alternative Hypothesis\nWe can formulate our hypothesis by asking questions differently. However, it is essential to understand what our end goal is. Here our dependent variable or target variable is **Survived**. Therefore, we say\n\n> ** Null Hypothesis($H_0$)** There is no difference in the survival rate between the male and female passengers. or the mean difference between male and female passenger in the survival rate is zero.  \n>  ** Alternative Hypothesis($H_A$):** There is a difference in the survival rate between the male and female passengers. or the mean difference in the survival rate between male and female is not zero. \n\n#### Determine the test statistics\n> This will be a two-tailed test since the difference between male and female passenger in the survival rate could be higher or lower than 0. \n> Since we do not know the standard deviation($\\sigma$) and n is small, we will use the t-distribution. \n\n#### Specify the significance level\n> Specifying a significance level is an important step of the hypothesis test. It is an ultimate balance between type 1 error and type 2 error. We will discuss more in-depth about those in another lesson. For now, we have decided to make our significance level($\\alpha$) = 0.05. So, our confidence interval or non-rejection region would be (1 - $\\alpha$) =   95%. \n\n#### Computing T-statistics and P-value\nLet's take a random sample and see the difference."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"abd034cffc591bf1ef2b4a8ed3e5a65eb133d61e","_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"male_mean = train[train['Sex'] == 1].Survived.mean()\n\nfemale_mean = train[train['Sex'] == 0].Survived.mean()\nprint (\"Male survival mean: \" + str(male_mean))\nprint (\"female survival mean: \" + str(female_mean))\n\nprint (\"The mean difference between male and female survival rate: \" + str(female_mean - male_mean))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"0c1c27af262ba094ff1fd02867b1a41d5369720f"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now, we have to understand that those two means are not  **the population mean**.  *The population mean is a statistical term statistician uses to indicate the actual average of the entire group.

Which is almost impossible and if we were to go that route; there is no point of doing statistics in the first place. Therefore we approach this problem using sample sets. The idea of using sample set is that; if we take multiple samples of the same population and take the mean of them and put them in a distribution; eventually our distribution start to look more like a **normal distribution**. The more samples we take and the more sample means with be added and the closer the normal distribution with reach towards population mean. This is where **Central limit theory** comes from. We will go into this topic later on. \n\nGoing back to our dataset, like we are saying these means above are part of the whole story. We were given part of the data to train our machine learning models, and the other part of the data was held back for testing.

When we perform a **t-test** we are usually trying to find out **an evidence of significant difference between population mean with hypothesized mean(1 sample t-test) or in our case difference between two population means(2 sample t-test).** \n\n\n\nThe **t-statistics** is the measure of a degree to which our groups differ standardized by the variance of our measurements. In order words, it is basically the measure of signal over noise. Let us describe the previous sentence a bit more for clarification. I am going to use [this post](http://blog.minitab.com/blog/statistics-and-quality-data-analysis/what-is-a-t-test-and-why-is-it-like-telling-a-kid-to-clean-up-that-mess-in-the-kitchen) as reference to describe the t-statistics here. \n\n\n#### Calculating the t-statistics\n# $$t = \\frac{\\bar{x}-\\mu}{\\frac{S} {\\sqrt{n}} }$$\n\nHere..\n* $\\bar{x}$ is the sample mean. \n* $\\mu$ is the hypothesized mean. \n* S is the standard devaition. \n* n is the sample size. \n\n\nNow, the denominator of this fraction $(\\bar{x}-\\mu)$ is basically the strength of the signal. where we calculate the difference between hypothesized mean and sample mean. If the mean difference is higher, then the signal is stronger. \n\nthe numerator of this fraction ** ${S}/ {\\sqrt{n}}$ ** calculates the amount of variation or noise of the data set. Here S is standard deviation, which tells us how much variation is there in the data. n is the sample size. \n\nSo, according to the explanation above, the t-value or t-statistics is basically measures the strength of the signal(the difference) to the amount of noise(the variation) in the data and that is how we calculate the t-value in one sample t-test. However, in order to calculate between two sample population mean or in our case we will use the follow equation. \n\n# $$t = \\frac{\\bar{x}_M - \\bar{x}_F}{\\sqrt {s^2 (\\frac{1}{n_M} + \\frac{1}{n_F})}}$$\n\nThis equation may seem too complex, however, the idea behind these two are similar.

So, why do we still have to split our training data? If you are curious about that, I have the answer. For this competition, when we train the machine learning algorithms, we use part of the training set usually two-thirds of the train data. Once we train our algorithm using 2/3 of the train data, we start to test our algorithms using the remaining data. If the model performs well we dump our test data in the algorithms to predict and submit the competition.

Logistic Regression\n<a id=\"logistic_regression\"></a>\n***\nWe will start with one of the most basic but effective machine learning model, **Logistic Regression**. Logistic regression is a famous classifier still used today frequently despite its age. It is a regression similar to **Linear regression**, yet operates as a classifier. In order to understand logistic regression we should have some idea about linear regression. Let's have a look at it. \n\nHopefully, we all know that, any linear equation can be written in the form of..\n\n# $$ {y} = mX + b $$\n\n* Here, m = slope of the regression line. it represents the relationship between X and y. \n* b = y-intercept. \n* x and y are the points location in x_axis and y_axis respectively. \n<br/>\n\nIf you want to know how, checkout this [video](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/two-var-linear-equations/writing-slope-intercept-equations/v/graphs-using-slope-intercept-form). So, this slope equation can also be written as..\n\n## $$ y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\epsilon \\\\ $$\n\nThis is the equation for a simple linear regression.\nhere,\n* y = Dependent variable. \n* $\\beta_0$ = the intercept, it is constant. \n* $\\beta_1$ = Coefficient of independent variable. \n* $x$ = Indepentent variable. \n* $ \\epsilon$ = error or residual. \n\n\nWe use this function to predict the value of a dependent variable with the help of only one independent variable. Therefore this regression is called **Simple Linear Regression.** \n\nSimilar to **Simple Linear Regression**, there is **Multiple Linear Regression** which can be used to predict dependent variable using multiple independent variables. Let's look at the equation for **Multiple Linear Regression**, \n\n## $$ \\hat{y} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + ... + \\beta_n x_n $$\n\n\nIf you would like to know more about **Linear Regression** checkout this [kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/masumrumi/a-stats-analysis-and-ml-workflow-of-house-pricing). \n\nSo, we know/reviewed a bit about linear regression and therefore we know how to deal data that looks like this, \n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Linear_regression.svg/1200px-Linear_regression.svg.png)\nHere the data point's in this graph is continous and therefore the problem is a regression one.

But, how do we make sure that our model is performing well? Our model may be overfitting or underfitting. In fact for those of you don't know what is overfitting and underfitting. let's find out.\n\n![](https://cdncontribute.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/fittings.jpg)\n\nAs you see in the chart above. **Underfitting** is when the model fails to capture important aspects of the data and therefore introduces more bias and performs poorly. On the other hand, **Overfitting** is when the model performs too well on the training data but does poorly in the validation set or test sets.  This situation is also known as having less bias but more variation and perform poorly as well. Ideally we want to configure a model that performs well not only in the training data, but also in the test data. This is where **bias-variance tradeoff** comes in. When we have a model that overfits meaning less biased and more chance of variance, we introduce some bias in exchance of having much less variance. One particular tactics for this task is regularization models (Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net).  These models are build to deal with bias-variance tradeoff. This [kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/underfitting-and-overfitting) explains this topic really well. Also the following chart gives us a mental picture of where we want our models to be. \n![](http://scott.fortmann-roe.com/docs/docs/BiasVariance/biasvariance.png)\n\nIdeally we want to pick a sweet spot where the model performs well in training set, validation set and test set. As the model gets more complex, bias decreases, variences increases. However, the most important part is the error rates. We want our models to be at the bottom of that **U** shape where the error rate is the least. That sweet spot is also known as **Optimum Model Complexity(OMC).**\n\nNow what we know what we want interms of upder-fitting and over-fitting, let's talk about how to combat them. \n\nHow to combat over-fitting?\n* Simplify the model by using less parameters. \n* Simplify the model by changing the hyperparameters. \n* Introducing regularization models. \n* Use more training data. \n* Gatter more data ( and gather better quality data).

These optimal parameters are also known as **Hyperparameters**. **The Hyperparameters are model parameters that are set prior to fit the model and determine the behavior of the model.**. For example, when we choose to use linear regression, we may decide to add penalty to the loss function such as Ridge or Lasso. These penalties require specific alpha (the strength of the regularization technique) to be set. The higher the value of alpha, the more penalty is being added. GridSearch finds the optimal value of alpha amoung a range of values provided by us and then we go on and use that optimal value to fit the model and get sweet results. It is important to understand that model parameters are different than models outcomes, for example, **coefficients** or model evaluation metrics such as **accuracy score** or **mean squared error**.\n\nGridSearch is really good at finding optimal values.
