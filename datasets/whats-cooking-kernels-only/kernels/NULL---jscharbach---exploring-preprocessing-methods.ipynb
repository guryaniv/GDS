Specifically, what are some preprocessing techniques we can try to see if they improve the results, and how can we be careful about making sure they're actually producing *real* improvement (and not just over-fitting based on noise).\n\nTo do that, we're going to build a test harness that lets us quickly test whether a new technique is an improvement over baseline, and then try out 5 different techniques for improving our results:\n\n1. Outlier removal\n2. Upsampling\n3. Stemming\n4. n-grams\n5. Stop-word removal\n\nThe main take-away here shouldn't be whether any given technique works or not, but rather how we can systematically check whether techniques work, and understand (1) why things might not work and (2) when we might use a technique even though it doesn't seem to produce an improvement."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"afc76314f49cd5d9bcacbdcd7b977a917fa5fdb2"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Setup\nFirst, let's import all the modules we need, neatly and alphabetized like we're trying to impress our boss.

However, several techniques did reduce our dimensionality without materially affecting our accuracy, which should improve our training times and make our classifier more robust against over-fitting... so we've gained some useful insights.\n\nMore generally, though, we've got a little test harness we can use to quickly investigate whether a given technique improves our accuracy, similar to what we might be able to do with a parameter search, but with a bit more flexibility. That should allow us to quickly investigate different lines of inquiry, and shut them down if they don't seem to be going anywhere.\n\nIn terms of next steps, here are two concrete preprocessing suggestions:\n\n1. **Adding meta-features** (e.g., # of ingredients, # of different types of special characters, etc). My initial exploration suggested meta-features didn't help (likely due to over-fitting), but maybe I didn't find the right meta-feature. Best practice for that would a [FeatureUnion pipeline](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/hetero_feature_union.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-hetero-feature-union-py).\n2. **Combining 1-grams and n-grams** (e.g., feeding both 1-grams and n-ngrams into a classifier). Again, I didn't find this to help, but if you were aggressive about identifying and dumping junk 1-grams and junk n-grams, and tried to keep the TF-IDF's vocabulary at around the same number of words, I could see that helping. \n\nUntil next time, I hope that this was helpful for getting the creative juices flowing."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
