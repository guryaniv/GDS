Context This data set includes customers who have paid off their loans, who
have been past due and put into collection without paying back their loan and
interests, and who have paid off only after they were put in collection. The
financial product is a bullet loan that customers should pay off all of their
loan debt in just one time by the end of the term, instead of an installment
schedule. Of course, they could pay off earlier than their pay schedule.
