All was well in Santa's workshop. The gifts were made, the route was planned,
the naughty and nice list complete. Santa thought this would finally be the
year he didn't need Kaggle's help with his combinatorial conundrums. At last,
the Claus family could take the elves and reindeer on that well deserved
vacation to the South Pole. Then, with just days until the big night, Santa
received an email from a panicked database admin elf. Attached was a server
log with the six least jolly words a jolly old St. Nick could read: ALTER
TABLE Gifts DROP COLUMN Weight One of the North Pole elf interns had
mistakenly deleted the weights for all of the inventory in the workshop! Santa
didn't have a backup (remember, this is a guy who makes a list and checks it
twice) and, without knowing each present's weight, he didn't know how he would
safely pack his many gift bags. Gifts were already on their way to the sleigh
packing facility and there wasn't time to re-weigh all the presents. It was
once again necessary to summon the holiday talents of Kaggle's elite. Can you
help Santa fill his multiple bags with sets of uncertain gifts? Save the
season by turning Santa's uncertain probabilities into presents for good
little boys and girls.
