Submissions are evaluated according to the Mean Average Precision @ 3 (MAP@3):
MAP@3= 1 U ∑ u=1 U ∑ k=1 min(n,3) P(k) where U is the number of scored audio
files in the test data, P(k) is the precision at cutoff k, and n is the number
predictions per audio file. You can learn more about this metric works from
this kernel, and from this python code. Submission File For each fname (audio
file) in the test set, you may predict up to 3 audio classification labels.
The file should contain a header and have the following format: fname,label
