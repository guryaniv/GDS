You can have a look at the most recent and what prizes they offer.\n\n![](https://jhonatandasilva.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/1blog.png)\n\n### Looking at the competitions\n\nIn this tutorial we're going to be creating for the recent ( late 2018 ) Humpback Whale Identification Challenge, but you can explore so many others like the PetFinder. MNIST is a good place to start, you can look have a look at how simple it is.  \n\n![](https://jhonatandasilva.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/3blog.png)\n\n\n### Creating your first Kernel\n\nNow we get to the competitions page, you can see a blue button called \"New Kernel\", just press it .\n\n![](https://jhonatandasilva.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/4blog.png)\n\n\n### Using Jupyter NOTEBOOKS\n\nIf you have never heard of [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) ( Do you live in a cave? hahhaa ). They are an amazing resource to share replicable code, they were used even for the [Gravitational Waves](https://www.gw-openscience.org/GW150914data/GW150914_tutorial.html)! Pretty amazing not? We are going to be using them in our Kernels at Kaggle\n\n![](https://jhonatandasilva.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/5blog.png)\n\n### Game ON!\n\nNow the Game is On! We can have amazing Kernels and share with the community!\n\n![](https://jhonatandasilva.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/6blog.png)\n\n### Commiting your changes\n\nIf you aren't familiar with the term commit have a look [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruieT3Nkg2M) (This channel has also Amazing resources within the Data Science field! ). You can commit your changes, don't worry, this wont make your Kernel public yet, you can go nuts!\n\n![](https://jhonatandasilva.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/7blog.png)\n\n### Your profile has your Kernels! \n\nYou finished all your code and tests and now you are ready to move on! Make the final commit and go to your profile. There lies your precious Kernels! \n\n![](https://jhonatandasilva.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/8blog.png)\n\n### Almost There!\n\nYou can open your Kernel by clicling on the title\n\n![](https://jhonatandasilva.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/9blog.png)\n\n### Go PUBLIC\n\nTo make your now Private Kernel Public you need to click on the \"Access\" button\n\n![](https://jhonatandasilva.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/10blog.png)\n\n### Be PROUD\n\nChange the Privacy Options from Private to Public and that's it! But wait, my kernel isn't showing up, I know I know, I've been were you are. If you went to the [public kernels](https://www.kaggle.com/c/humpback-whale-identification/kernels) and didn't find your own, don't panic, the Kaggle website takes sometime to update the Kernels. Now be PROUD, you've made your very first public Kernel!\n\n![](https://jhonatandasilva.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/11blog.png)\n\n### The Ultimate Guide to Work with Large datasets!\n\nI've created a [Kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/jhonatansilva31415/the-ultimate-guide-to-load-your-whales) on how to work with all of the whales and don't kill your computer while your at it!\n\n\n### 10 MAJOR STEPS IN YOUR KERNEL\n\nIn this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXcTm4gFerE&t=1s) I'll show you how the 10 major steps in creating your very first simple model to the Whale Competion, this video is related to this [Kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/jhonatansilva31415/whales-a-simple-guide)!
