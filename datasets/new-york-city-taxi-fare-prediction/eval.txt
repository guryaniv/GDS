The evaluation metric for this competition is the root mean-squared error or
RMSE. RMSE measures the difference between the predictions of a model, and the
corresponding ground truth. A large RMSE is equivalent to a large average
error, so smaller values of RMSE are better. One nice property of RMSE is that
the error is given in the units being measured, so you can tell very directly
how incorrect the model might be on unseen data. RMSE is given by: RMSE= √ 1 n
n ∑ i=1 ( ˆ y i−yi)2 where yi is the i observation and ˆ y i is the prediction
for that observation. Example 1. Suppose we have one observation, with an
actual value of 12.5 and a prediction of 12.5 (good job!). The RMSE will be:
RMSEexample1= √ 1 1 (12.5−12.5)2 =0 Example 2. We'll add another data point.
Your prediction for the second data point is 11.0 and the actual value is
14.0. The RMSE will be: RMSEexample2= √ 1 2 ((12.5−12.5)2+(11.0−14.0)2) = √ 9
