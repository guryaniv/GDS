These, in a nutshell, are dictionaries in the form `{word: word_prob}`.\n\nFor this task we will make use of the default Python library, `collections` and its `Counter` function. The function takes as input a list and outputs a dictionary in the form `{word: word_count}`, where `word_count` is the number of times the word appears in the list.\n\nIf we kept the distributions with the count of each word Naive Bayes would have to operate with very large numbers, which might throw an error. Instead, we will use the frequency of each word which is a number between 0 and 1 denoting the probability of the word appearing from the given author.\n\nWhat will happen though if a sentence we want to classify contains a word not in an author's distribution? The word's probability will be 0 which means the whole sentence will have a probability of 0. One single word made the sentence impossible to have come from the particular author. We need to take care of that. So, if a word does not appear in the distribution, we will assign to it a very small probability so that the calculations are not thrown off. We can do that with Python's `defaultdict`, which assigns a default value to keys not contained in the dictionary. In this case, the default value will be the minimum value in the distribution up to that point."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"7afc9d36-6ee1-4e80-a766-a55b5ec8ac95","_uuid":"57b2a2c5d7710cf0ec8da42cbd2e0ccbd01bc24e","collapsed":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from collections import Counter, defaultdict\n\ndef create_dist(text):\n    c = Counter(text)\n\n    least_common = c.most_common()[-1][1]\n    total = sum(c.values())\n    \n    for k, v in c.items():\n        c[k] = v/total\n\n    return defaultdict(lambda: min(c.values()), c)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"6ef407d4-c72c-44ba-9c66-ed70c64332f4","_uuid":"8faed07244b14ffe38a269fd8822ec60e587d17b"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now we will pass the texts through the function to get the counting distributions for each author:"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"84fb04fb-1d8d-463b-a13b-5ce3c9295189","_uuid":"cc0a70ce6b06f5047bc3ff1dd57f560809479c46","collapsed":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"c_eap, c_hpl, c_mws = create_dist(EAP), create_dist(HPL), create_dist(MWS)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"cc426133-9493-416f-b546-eb40c9ae8223","_uuid":"a5e40de682adacea4a73fd2266728d5ecf7c4e82"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Naive Bayes\n\nNow comes the part where we create our Naive Bayes Classifier.

Without much ado we managed to make a respectable ~0.5 submission. With a little tweaking, we could increase this slightly (for example, we could say that if an author has a probability >0.95, we will go on a limp and assume that author has a probability of 1.0; most likely we are correct and we decrease our error by about 0.05).\n\nWe could go a bit more in-depth and instead of creating one-word distributions, we created two-word distributions. A lot of authors might use two words together very often, which is a useful feature. But for this example that will do.\n\nCheers!"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.4","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
