If injury isn't apparent immediately and a penalty is thus an unsuitable deterant, a fine may be incurred on the perpetrater of the penalty after a confirmation later by video review (potential overlap with Rule 17 Section 2 Article 3).**\n2. **Expanding the defenseless player status to punt team players who are within 5 yards of the PR and are running towards their own endzone (this would be similar to the afforded protection to the punter, Rule 12 Section 2 Article 7-a-8)**\n\n#### Impact to the game:\n- Video replay would likely be played repeatedly during times of injuries, thus there shouldn't be much time lost if a referee is making a video review during that time. A resulting penalty would impact where the subsequent play will take place so certain returns may be negated.\n- Extending defenseless player status to punt team players who are within 5 yards of the PR and are running towards their own endzone would help to prevent these vicious blindside blocks. Behaviorally this would result in return team players having to shield the PR from behind by running with the PR and away from their endzone if they want to impede the pursuit of a nearby punt team player. Note that this rule would most often take affect when a punt team player is in pursuit from behind the PR (the whole aspect of running towards their own endzone)."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"f37bf3cb8ba9c7f889f63fbc07ef98838baf9e5a"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"- Just as an aside, it would be helpful to have NGS data on the referees to understand their positioning during such plays (x-y plane and facing direction) because when a penalty is not called its either the referee sees the encounter and flags or doesn't flag it, or they're not seeing the penalty at all, which compromises player safety.\n\n## Annotated Uncalled Penalties\n- NFL Rulebook: https://operations.nfl.com/media/3277/2018-nfl-rulebook_final-version.pdf\n- My interpretation of the following rules may be incorrect as I am not an expert official of the game, but they look pretty darn close to what would be considered illegal.\n- **Remember safety first, then teamwork.**\n\n### Blindside Block/Tackle on Defensless Player (Rule 12, Section 2, Article 7-a-10)\n- States Players in a Defenseless posture includes: A player who receives a “blindside” block when the path of the blocker is toward or parallel to his own end line.\n- (Section 1, Article-1-q) is mislabeled when referencing the section on blindside blocks as a headsup\n- https://operations.nfl.com/the-rules/nfl-video-rulebook/defenseless-player/\n    - See time stamp for video in link: 2:21 to 2:36\n        - The video states: When a blocker is moving parallel or towards his own endzone, the **legal strike zone** is below the neck and above the waist\n- All penalties are by the return team and are towards their own endzone\n\n#### Cases (GameKey, PlayID):"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"82ef2ff1967e94b2d03e319a41a1462a03f7cc2d"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**(54, 1045)**: CAR player strikes above the neck (you can hear the head contact) on PIT #41 at the CAR 37;
