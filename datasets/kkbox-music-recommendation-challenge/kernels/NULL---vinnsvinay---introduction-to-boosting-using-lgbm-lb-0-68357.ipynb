Typical values are from 0.01 to 0.2 and may extend upto 0.3. Higher the learning rate, faster the algorithm runs. Lower learning rates help the algorithm in generalising well but take a lot more training time.\n", "\n", "\t2. n_estimators: Number of trees to fit. I haven't found many resources on how this parameter behaves with respect to LGBM but what I have observed it is generally results in a higher score. It also generalises the model better with more trees. Training time is directly proportial to number of trees initially and then tends to increase more than linear as it gets harder and harder to increase the accuracy of models. \n", "\n", "(Extra information: If we dig into lgbm code(https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM/blob/master/python-package/lightgbm/engine.py) and sklearn code for lgbm(https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM/blob/e5eb8560af16ec502179e436a4e78749d1c54b0a/python-package/lightgbm/sklearn.py) we can see that n_estimators is same as num_boost_round which is equivalent to any on of these \"num_iterations\", \"num_iteration\", \"num_tree\", \"num_trees\", \"num_round\", \"num_rounds\".)\n", "\n", "\t3. max_bin: maximum number of buckets used.
