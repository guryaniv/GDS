In 2013, we hosted one of our favorite for-fun competitions: Dogs vs. Cats.
Much has since changed in the machine learning landscape, particularly in deep
learning and image analysis. Back then, a tensor flow was the diffusion of the
creamer in a bored mathematician's cup of coffee. Now, even the cucumber
farmers are neural netting their way to a bounty. Much has changed at Kaggle
as well. Our online coding environment Kernels didn't exist in 2013, and so it
was that we approached sharing by scratching primitive glpyhs on cave walls
with sticks and sharp objects. No more. Now, Kernels have taken over as the
way to share code on Kaggle. IPython is out and Jupyter Notebook is in. We
even have TensorFlow. What more could a data scientist ask for? But seriously,
what more? Pull requests welcome. We are excited to bring back the infamous
Dogs vs. Cats classification problem as a playground competition with kernels
enabled. Although modern techniques may make light of this once-difficult
problem, it is through practice of new techniques on old datasets that we will
make light of machine learning's future challenges.
