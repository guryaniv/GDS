Read the data\n    ```Python\n    import pandas as pd\n    import numpy as np\n    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n    import seaborn as sns\n    \n    file = r'C:\\Users\\yingk\\Desktop\\PUBG Data\\train_V2.csv'\n    train = pd.read_csv(file)\n    pd.set_option('display.max_columns',30)\n    ```\n2. Overview\n    ```Python\n    train.columns\n    train.shape\n    train.head()\n    train.info()\n    ```\n    There are 30 columns in the dataset.<br> \n    ![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/u8SoK3D.png)<br>\n    The dataframe shape is: ![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/mINvU9H.png)<br>\n    Here is the head rows of the dataframe:<br>\n    ![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/sTfxXHy.png)<br>\n    Data types:<br>\n    ![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/vLBUWM8.png)<br>\n    **Data fields**\n    DBNOs - Number of enemy players knocked.<br>\n    assists - Number of enemy players this player damaged that were killed by teammates.<br>\n    boosts - Number of boost items used.<br>\n    damageDealt - Total damage dealt. Note: Self inflicted damage is subtracted.<br>\n    headshotKills - Number of enemy players killed with headshots.<br>\n    heals - Number of healing items used.<br>\n    Id - Player’s Id<br>\n    killPlace - Ranking in match of number of enemy players killed.<br>\n    killPoints - Kills-based external ranking of player. (Think of this as an Elo ranking where only kills matter.) If there is a value other than -1 in rankPoints, then any 0 in killPoints should be treated as a “None”.<br>\n    killStreaks - Max number of enemy players killed in a short amount of time.<br>\n    kills - Number of enemy players killed.<br>\n    longestKill - Longest distance between player and player killed at time of death. This may be misleading, as downing a player and driving away may lead to a large longestKill stat.<br>\n    matchDuration - Duration of match in seconds.<br>\n    matchId - ID to identify match. There are no matches that are in both the training and testing set.<br>\n    matchType - String identifying the game mode that the data comes from. The standard modes are “solo”, “duo”, “squad”, “solo-fpp”, “duo-fpp”, and “squad-fpp”; other modes are from events or custom matches.<br>\n    rankPoints - Elo-like ranking of player. This ranking is inconsistent and is being deprecated in the API’s next version, so use with caution. Value of -1 takes place of “None”.<br>\n    revives - Number of times this player revived teammates.<br>\n    rideDistance - Total distance traveled in vehicles measured in meters.<br>\n    roadKills - Number of kills while in a vehicle.<br>\n    swimDistance - Total distance traveled by swimming measured in meters.<br>\n    teamKills - Number of times this player killed a teammate.<br>\n    vehicleDestroys - Number of vehicles destroyed.<br>\n    walkDistance - Total distance traveled on foot measured in meters.<br>\n    weaponsAcquired - Number of weapons picked up.<br>\n    winPoints - Win-based external ranking of player. (Think of this as an Elo ranking where only winning matters.) If there is a value other than -1 in rankPoints, then any 0 in winPoints should be treated as a “None”.<br>\n    groupId - ID to identify a group within a match. If the same group of players plays in different matches, they will have a different groupId each time.<br>\n    numGroups - Number of groups we have data for in the match.<br>\n    maxPlace - Worst placement we have data for in the match. This may not match with numGroups, as sometimes the data skips over placements.<br>\n    winPlacePerc - The target of prediction. This is a percentile winning placement, where 1 corresponds to 1st place, and 0 corresponds to last place in the match. It is calculated off of maxPlace, not numGroups, so it is possible to have missing chunks in a match.<br>\n3. Check Missing Values\n    ```Python\n    train.isna().sum()\n    train[train['winPlacePerc'].isna()]\n    train.dropna(inplace=True)\n    ```\n    ![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/YieKXxf.png)<br>\n    There is only one missing value in the entire dataset, we could simply drop it.<br>\n4. Check Correlations\n    ```Python\n    corr = train.corr()\n    plt.figure(figsize=(12,12))\n    sns.heatmap(corr, cmap='coolwarm',linewidths=0.5)\n    plt.show()\n    ```\n    ![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/PypzUCc.png)<br>\n    Dark square means high correlation between features, usually 0.8 indicates a strong correlation. We could proceed to further look into the features with high correlations.<br>\n    ```Python\n    high_related = corr.apply(lambda value:(np.abs(value)>0.8))\n    plt.figure(figsize=(12,12))\n    sns.heatmap(high_related,cbar=False, cmap='viridis',linewidths=0.5)\n    ```\n    ![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/6j1JfoM.png)<br>\n    ```Python\n    #damageDealt and kills\n    train.plot(x='damageDealt', y='kills', kind='scatter',figsize=(15,10))\n    ```\n    ![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Ux3QVEO.png)<br>\n    Clear linear relation between damageDealt and kills.<br>\n    ```Python\n    #killPlace and kills\n    train.plot(x='killPlace', y='kills', kind='scatter',figsize=(15,10))\n    train[(train['killPlace']<10) & (train['kills']<=1)][['kills','killPlace']]\n    ```\n    ![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/u8SoK3D.png)<br>\n    ![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/OJdyEtm.png)<br>\n    It seems there is some incosistency with killPlace and kills. There are players who kills 0 but have a high rank in killPlace. Need further investigate these two features.<br>\n    ```Python\n    #killPoints and rankPoints\n    train.plot(x='killPoints', y='rankPoints', kind='scatter',figsize=(15,10))\n    train[['killPoints','rankPoints']]\n    train['killPoints'].value_counts()\n    train['rankPoints'].value_counts()\n    #killPoints and winPoints\n    train.plot(x='killPoints', y='winPoints', kind='scatter',figsize=(15,10))\n    train['winPoints'].value_counts()\n    ```\n    ![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/fpuDrnv.png)<br>\n    ![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/c5Fbe2m.png)<br>\n    ![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/z19MoXs.png)<br>\n    ![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/6mK4d7H.png)<br>\n    ![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/c5Fbe2m.png)<br>\n    ![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/zvvbgkU.png)<br>\n    There are too many missing values in killPoints, rankPoints and winPoints. Therefore, not suggesting using these three features in prediction model.<br>\n    ```Python\n    #kills and killStreaks\n    train.plot(x='kills', y='killStreaks', kind='scatter',figsize=(15,10))\n    ```\n    ![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/jkGSEUd.png)<br>\n    ```Python\n    #maxPlace and numGroups\n    train.plot(x='maxPlace', y='numGroups', kind='scatter',figsize=(15,10))\n    ```\n    ![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/klCmQGo.png)<br>\n    maxPlace and numGroups are almost identical, according to data fields decription, suggest to drop maxPlace.<br>\n    ```Python\n    #walkDistance and winPlacePerc\n    train.plot(x='walkDistance', y='winPlacePerc', kind='scatter',figsize=(15,10))\n    train['walkDistance'].describe()\n    def bin_walkDistance(walkDistance):\n        if walkDistance<=155.1:\n            return '0-25%'\n        elif walkDistance<=685.6:\n            return '25-50%'\n        elif walkDistance<=1976:\n            return '50-75%'\n        else:\n            return '75-100%'\n    train['walkDistBins'] = train['walkDistance'].apply(bin_walkDistance)\n    plt.figure(figsize=(15,10))\n    sns.boxplot(x='walkDistBins',y='winPlacePerc',data=train,palette='rainbow',order=['0-25%','25-50%','50-75%','75-100%'])\n    ```\n    ![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/pHGM4iJ.png)<br>\n    ![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/KgKTIPP.png)<br>\n    By splitting the walkDistance into four bins, we could easily tell from the boxplot that higher walkDistance would indicate a high winPlacePerc. We could consider to separate the data according to walkDistance, and fit them into models separately since the target distributions differs a lot within the four bins.\n    \n"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","collapsed":true,"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":false},"cell_type":"markdown","source":""}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
