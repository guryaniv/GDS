Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) Submissions are scored on the root mean squared
error. RMSE is defined as: RMSE= √ 1 n n ∑ i=1 (yi− ˆ y i)2 , where y hat is
the predicted value and y is the original value. Submission File For each
item_id in the test set, you must predict a probability for the
deal_probability. Your predictions must be in the range [0, 1]. The submission
file should contain a header and have the following format:
item_id,deal_probability 2,0 5,0 6,0 etc.
