The others planets will have Gravity Function in between these min and max Gravity Functions.\n\nThe ordered gravity function from smallest to largest gives the path between these two points.\n\nThe Gravity Function between planet 1 and planet 2 is the mass of planet 1 times the mass of planet 2 divided by the squared distance of these two planets. Each planet would have a total gravity Funcion that is the sum of all gravity function among this planet and all other planets.\n\nSimulating Neural Network algorithms, Gravity Falls algorithm works as follow:\n    \n- Define batch size, k-lambda:\nBatch size the the percentage of points that we will change during backward propagation\nk-lambda is the proportion of the step of change during backward propagation\n\n- Initiate m that is the mass of all points, let m(0) be small and M(n) be big, 0 being the initial point of path and n the end point of path\n\n- Forward:\n    Calculate Gravity Function of all points\n    Define path as the ordered gravity function\n    Calculate the cost, that is the distance of the points in path\n\n- Backward:\n    Select batch points with the highest cost\n    Find the gravity function of the closest point (for all batch points)\n    Change the gravity of the points towards the closest point´s Gravity Funcion (step = k-lambda)\n    Calculate the expected mass of the point to achieve this result    \n\nI was not able to vectorize the algorithm so it definitely does not perform very well."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"5751cefefe0eb85830f6f26a004b4e25523e5704"},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport math\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"bf974a9a90a16b3fd1d614399d76ab7052ce3317"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Function that calculates the Gravity Function for each point\n# Due to memory issues, I was not able to store temporary data, just the result\n# The gravity function of a given point is the sum of the gravity function bewtween this point and all others\n# The gravity function of two points 1 and 2 equals to M1 * M2 /  (distance between theses two points ) **2\n\ndef Gravity_Function(df):\n    for i in df.index:\n        #print(i)\n        currentx, currenty, currentm = df.loc[i,\"X\"], df.loc[i,\"Y\"], df.loc[i,\"m\"]\n        mask1 = df.index == i\n        temp = df[~(mask1)].copy()\n        temp[\"distance\"] =  temp[\"m\"] * currentm / ( (currentx-temp[\"X\"]) **2 + (currenty- temp[\"Y\"])**2)\n        dist = temp[\"distance\"].sum()\n        df.loc[i,\"gf\"] = dist","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"13fcf85e54d9a24ca6499010ccfa64cc57253868"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Function that returns the gravity function of the closest point for a given point times k_lambda (between 0 and 1)\n# k_lamba is the step size of the change in the gravity function of the points        \n# Processes a batch of points\n\ndef Gravity_Function_batch(df,df_points, k_lambda):\n        lista = []\n        for i in df_points.index.values:\n            currentx, currenty, current_gf = df_points.loc[i ,\"X\"], df_points.loc[i,\"Y\"], df_points.loc[i,\"gf\"]\n            mask1 = df.index == i\n            temp = df[~(mask1)].copy()\n            temp[\"distance\"] =  (currentx-temp[\"X\"]) **2 + (currenty- temp[\"Y\"])**2\n            closest_point = temp[temp[\"distance\"]== temp[\"distance\"].min()][\"gf\"].index.values[0]\n            closest_point_gf = temp[temp[\"distance\"]== temp[\"distance\"].min()][\"gf\"].values[0]\n            if  closest_point_gf > current_gf :\n                walk_to = current_gf + ( closest_point_gf -
