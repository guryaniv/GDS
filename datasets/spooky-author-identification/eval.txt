Submissions are evaluated using multi-class logarithmic loss. Each id has one
true class. For each id, you must submit a predicted probability for each
author. The formula is then: logloss=− 1 N ∑ i=1 N ∑ j=1 M y ij log( p ij ),
where N is the number of observations in the test set, M is the number of
class labels (3 classes), log l is the natural logarithm, y ij y is 1 if
observation i i belongs to class j j and 0 otherwise, and p ij p is the
predicted probability that observation i i belongs to class j j . The
submitted probabilities for a given sentences are not required to sum to one
because they are rescaled prior to being scored (each row is divided by the
row sum). In order to avoid the extremes of the log function, predicted
probabilities are replaced with max(min(p,1− 10 −15 ), 10 −15 ) m . Submission
File You must submit a csv file with the id, and a probability for each of the
three classes. The order of the rows does not matter. The file must have a
header and should look like the following: id,EAP,HPL,MWS
id07943,0.33,0.33,0.33 ...
