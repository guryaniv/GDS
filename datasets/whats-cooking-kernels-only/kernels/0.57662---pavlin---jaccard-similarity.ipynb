For each recipie, we are given a set of ingredients used and then we have to determine which cuisine the recipie belongs to. Given that we are given sets of ingredients, which are typically a word or two, there is no real structure here that NLP algorithms can take.\n\nGiven that we're working with sets, a natural choice of metric is the Jaccard similarity, combined with a simple k-nearest neighbors classifier. This, to me, seems much simpler than fancy GloVe or word2vec embeddings, combined with neural nets or SVMs.\n\nIn this notebook, I implement a simple weighted voting scheme with k-nearest neighbors using the Jaccard similarity index. I use an arbitrary LSH approximate nearest neighbor library because I did not want to wait for the exact nearest neighbors to be computed.\n\nFirst, we have to build up the LSH index. We will use this to query the nearest neighbor for every test point."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"with open('../input/train.json') as file:\n    training_data = json.load(file)\n\nlsh = MinHashLSHForest(num_perm=128)\ntrain, y_train_str = {}, {}\nfor entry in training_data:\n    # Compute min-hash and add to LSH\n    min_hash = MinHash(num_perm=128)\n    for e in entry['ingredients']:\n        min_hash.update(e.encode('utf-8'))\n    lsh.add(entry['id'], min_hash)\n    \n    # We may want to use the raw data later on\n    train[entry['id']] = entry['ingredients']\n    y_train_str[entry['id']] = entry['cuisine']\n\nlsh.index()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"eea130ed97e76548dad95f816b4fc08211a6ab3f"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In order to make working with numpy simpler, we convert the target labels (cuisine) to integers."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"da031a65afb67787cba5a0dff16df82d104b5af6","collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"label_encoder = preprocessing.LabelEncoder()\nlabel_encoder.fit(list(y_train_str.values()))\ny_train = {eid: label_encoder.transform([y_train_str[eid]])[0] for eid in y_train_str}","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"a0ad05cf3b6206cb5681bb98dd580b2eab9210c1"},"cell_type":"code","source":"def jaccard_similarity(x, y):\n    return len(set(x) & set(y)) / len(set(x) | set(y))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"173709475fbf30be907420cd268c90e7eeaff397"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We will use an arbitrary number of neighbors for demonstrative purposes."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"8eca7527e638d3ecadf6f3206eecfde3a380ba60"},"cell_type":"code","source":"N_NEAREST_NEIGHBORS = 100","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"a261d26d2a7563355cecd3d260d3d6245e89f172"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"To predict on the test set, the K nearest neighbors are found.
