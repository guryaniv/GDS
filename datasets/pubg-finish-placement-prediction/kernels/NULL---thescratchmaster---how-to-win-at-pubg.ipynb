Note: Self inflicted damage is subtracted.\n<li>headshotKills - Number of enemy players killed with headshots.\n<li>heals - Number of healing items used.\n<li>Id - Player’s Id\n<li>killPlace - Ranking in match of number of enemy players killed.\n<li>killPoints - Kills-based external ranking of player. (Think of this as an Elo ranking where only kills matter.) If there is a value other than -1 in rankPoints, then any 0 in killPoints should be treated as a “None”.\n<li>killStreaks - Max number of enemy players killed in a short amount of time.\n<li>kills - Number of enemy players killed.\n<li>longestKill - Longest distance between player and player killed at time of death. This may be misleading, as downing a player and driving away may lead to a large longestKill stat.\n<li>matchDuration - Duration of match in seconds.\n<li>matchId - ID to identify match. There are no matches that are in both the training and testing set.\n<li>matchType - String identifying the game mode that the data comes from. The standard modes are “solo”, “duo”, “squad”, “solo-fpp”, “duo-fpp”, and “squad-fpp”; other modes are from events or custom matches.\nrankPoints - Elo-like ranking of player. This ranking is inconsistent and is being deprecated in the API’s next version, so use with caution. Value of -1 takes place of “None”.\n<li>revives - Number of times this player revived teammates.\n<li>rideDistance - Total distance traveled in vehicles measured in meters.\n<li>roadKills - Number of kills while in a vehicle.\n<li>swimDistance - Total distance traveled by swimming measured in meters.\n<li>teamKills - Number of times this player killed a teammate.\n<li>vehicleDestroys - Number of vehicles destroyed.\n<li>walkDistance - Total distance traveled on foot measured in meters.\n<li>weaponsAcquired - Number of weapons picked up.\n<li>winPoints - Win-based external ranking of player. (Think of this as an Elo ranking where only winning matters.) If there is a value other than -1 in rankPoints, then any 0 in winPoints should be treated as a “None”.\ngroupId - ID to identify a group within a match. If the same group of players plays in different matches, they will have a different groupId each time.\n<li>numGroups - Number of groups we have data for in the match.\n<li>maxPlace - Worst placement we have data for in the match. This may not match with numGroups, as sometimes the data skips over placements.\n<li>winPlacePerc - The target of prediction. This is a percentile winning placement, where 1 corresponds to 1st place, and 0 corresponds to last place in the match. It is calculated off of maxPlace, not numGroups, so it is possible to have missing chunks in a match."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"4fe2ebe60500534741ca9e169955cc4feb6ba6f3"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Working with the Data\n<br>\nFirst lets start with the standard procedure of loading the Data in"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false,"_uuid":"e6dc495f52a3de1bf294fdc93e88d7f138c29509"},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport gc\n\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport numpy as np\n\nimport random\nrandom.seed(42)\n\nfrom scipy.stats import norm\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom scipy import stats \nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.metrics import r2_score\n\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error\n\nimport warnings \nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n%matplotlib inline\n\ntrain_f = pd.read_csv(\"train_V2.csv\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"62dbcb01696ad7174b0e2082d41efc1d36c5a96e"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Heres what the data looks like"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false,"_uuid":"78cdff9f7a2db857443691acd5ba050d590dfb36"},"cell_type":"code","source":"train_f.head(5)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"0e9421f3dd72584ec19288812cee182d3b143fcc"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Lets look at general info about our Data"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false,"_uuid":"987b2357f81861129d77f3e0cfdbc2ec32c3cd7e"},"cell_type":"code","source":"train_f.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"963725caf264053e2ae06034fc972736059e9b6e"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"With all the different parameters and games with this dataset, its in our best interest to save some memory"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"c3b65ac024e5c9a4733864cd8de35914c5d272ee"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We can do better if we know what features we are targeting.

The method by which we improve this model is underspecified, and each specific boosting implementation performs it differently.\n\nGenerally, the improvement method is as follows: take the parts of the data where the model has done poorly and retrain a new version of the model on this \"failed\" data it is then combined with new data, in hopes that overall it preforms better.\n\nFor our model we chose to use: CatBoost, a recently open-sourced machine learning algorithm from Yandex. \n\nA reasonf for using Catboost is that it handles Categorical features automatically: We can use CatBoost without any explicit pre-processing to convert categories into numbers. CatBoost converts categorical values into numbers using various statistics on combinations of categorical features and combinations of categorical and numerical features. \n\nIt also reduces the need for extensive hyper-parameter tuning and lower the chances of overfitting also which leads to more generalized models."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"340fe8971b5842bf2149c69bc5bf8c4d2e880691"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We use R2 as the statistic that will give some information about how good our model is.
