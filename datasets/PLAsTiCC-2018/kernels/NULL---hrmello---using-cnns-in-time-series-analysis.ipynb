I've seen that people have started using NNs for a while now, but I didn't see people using CNNs. Indeed, it is pretty unusual, at least to me, to use a kind of network that performs so well on image data to treat time series. However, I'm completely in love with this kind of NN and I started looking for ways to use it here and I found [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.00886.pdf). There are several issues that we have to deal with along the preprocessing and evaluation steps but I believe that this could be a good starting point for those who want to try using CNNs. I prepared this notebook as an introduction in the topic and necessary preprocessing in case someone wants to investigate it deeper. IMHO, the greatest advantage of this method - and other DL techniques - is that we don't need worry about feature extraction.\n\nFirst of all, we'll need to load the data.

This is done by using the equation:\n\n$$ R_{i,j} = \\theta(\\epsilon - || s_i - s_j ||)$$\n\nwhere a $s$ are the states (time series values), ||.|| is the norm  and $\\epsilon$ is a threshold distance and $\\theta$ is the Heaviside (step) function. \n\nBelow are the functions I used to create a dictionary of such R matrices, where each key is a different object. You'll notice that I preferred to use a slightly different approach by using a sigmoid rather than Heaviside step function. I did so because since we are dealing with several different objects, it turns out that each one has a different \"optimal\" $\\epsilon$ in order to create a proper image. So for simplicity I opted to use sigmoid because it doesn't need tunning for each image.\n\nAfter each R matrix for each object and each passband is made, there is another issue that we need to worry about.  Since each object has 6 passbands, we need a way to put all of those images - one for each passband -  into a single image. My solution was to stack them up , in some kind of resemblance to a RGB image that has 3 channels. Here we will have 6 channels instead. The problem is: it is not guaranteed that each passband has the same number of observations, resulting in images of different sizes. If we want to stack them, they need to have the same shape. To solve that, I cropped all of them to the minimum size possible for that object - and here is where we begin to lose information. For instance, if an object has R matrices of shapes (30x30), (50x50) and (48x48), I'd shape them all to (30x30) so they can be stacked. This is done by `crop_obj_plots` function."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"9275ed05e8576b5362be46c4425c1f252e392769","scrolled":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"###recurrent plot\n\ndef sigmoid(x):\n    '''\n    Returns the sigmoid of a value\n    '''\n    return 1/(1+np.exp(-x))\n\ndef R_matrix(signal, eps):\n    '''\n    Given a time series (signal) and an epsilon,\n    return the Recurrent Plot matrix\n    '''\n    R = np.zeros((signal.shape[0], signal.shape[0]))\n    for i in range(R.shape[0]):\n        for j in range(R.shape[1]):\n            R[i][j] = np.heaviside((eps - abs(signal[i] - signal[j])),1)\n    return R\n\n#using sigmoid rather than heaviside\n#because in this dataset the epsilon parameter needs to\n#change from object to object and therefore should be learned as well\ndef R_matrix_modified(signal):\n    '''\n    Given a time series (signal) and an epsilon,\n    return the modified Recurrent Plot matrix\n    using sigmoid rather than heaviside\n    '''\n    R = np.zeros((signal.shape[0], signal.shape[0]))\n    for i in range(R.shape[0]):\n        for j in range(R.shape[1]):\n            R[i][j] = sigmoid((abs(signal[i] - signal[j])))\n    return R\n\ndef create_objects_dict(merged_dataset):\n    '''\n    Input: dataset containing both training data and metadata\n    Creates a dictionary using each object as keys and\n    one R matrix for each passband in that object\n    '''\n    objects = {}\n    for obj in tqdm(np.unique(merged_dataset.object_id)):\n        R_passbands = []\n        for passband in np.unique(merged_dataset.passband):\n            obj_flux = merged_dataset[(merged_dataset.object_id == obj) & (merged_dataset.passband == passband)].flux.values\n            R_passbands.append(R_matrix_modified(obj_flux))\n        objects[obj] = (np.asarray(R_passbands), max(merged_dataset[merged_dataset.object_id == obj].target))\n    return objects\n\ndef get_minmax_shapes(obj_R_matrices):\n    '''\n    Given an R matrix, get the min and max width \n    to be used to crop and let all images from a given\n    object be of the same size so they can be concatenated\n    '''\n    min_length = 0\n    max_length = 0\n    for passband in np.unique(merged.passband):\n        if passband == 0:\n            length = len(obj_R_matrices[passband])\n            min_length = length\n            max_length = length\n        else:\n            length = len(obj_R_matrices[passband])\n            min_length = min(min_length, length)\n            max_length = max(max_length, length)\n    return (min_length, max_length)\n\ndef crop_obj_plots(objects):\n    '''\n    Accepts a dictionary where each key is a different object\n    and each value is a tuple - one slot with a list of R matrices and \n    the other with the target value (object class)\n    '''\n    for obj in tqdm(objects.keys()):\n        min_len, max_len = get_minmax_shapes(objects[obj][0])\n        for passband in np.unique(merged.passband):\n            objects[obj][0][passband] = objects[obj][0][passband][:min_len, :min_len]\n    return objects\n\nobjects = create_objects_dict(merged)\ncropped_objects = crop_obj_plots(objects)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"b8ee58b710371d85ea845dbca519633d9aea9e7f"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now each object has a 6-channel image.
