It usually pays off to apply ensemble learning over and above various models you might be building. Time and again, people have used ensemble models in competitions like Kaggle and benefited from it.\n\nEnsemble learning is a broad topic and is only confined by your own imagination. For the purpose of this Notebook, I will cover the basic concepts and ideas of ensemble modeling. This should be enough for you to start building ensembles at your own end.

This dataset contains information about three different types of Iris flowers:\n\n* Iris Versicolor\n* Iris Virginica\n* Iris Setosa\n\nThe data set contains measurements of four variables :\n\n* sepal length \n* sepal width\n* petal length \n* petal width\n \nThe Iris data set has a number of interesting features:\n\n1. One of the classes (Iris Setosa) is linearly separable from the other two. However, the other two classes are not linearly separable.\n\n2. There is some overlap between the Versicolor and Virginica classes, so it is unlikely to achieve a perfect classification rate.\n\n3. There is some redundancy in the four input variables, so it is possible to achieve a good solution with only three of them, or even (with difficulty) from two, but the precise choice of best variables is not obvious.\n\n**Why am I  using iris dataset:**\n\n1- This is a good project because it is so well understood.\n\n2- Attributes are numeric so you have to figure out how to load and handle data.\n\n3- It is a classification problem, allowing you to practice with perhaps an easier type of supervised learning algorithm.\n\n4- It is a multi-class classification problem (multi-nominal) that may require some specialized handling.\n\n5- It only has 4 attributes and 150 rows, meaning it is small and easily fits into memory (and a screen or A4 page).\n\n6- All of the numeric attributes are in the same units and the same scale, not requiring any special scaling or transforms to get started.[5]\n\n7- we can define problem as clustering(unsupervised algorithm) project too.\n<a id=\"9\"></a> <br>\n### 5-2 Aim\nThe aim is to classify iris flowers among three species (setosa, versicolor or virginica) from measurements of length and width of sepals and petals\n<a id=\"10\"></a> <br>\n### 5-3 Variables\nThe variables are :\n**sepal_length**: Sepal length, in centimeters, used as input.\n**sepal_width**: Sepal width, in centimeters, used as input.\n**petal_length**: Petal length, in centimeters, used as input.\n**petal_width**: Petal width, in centimeters, used as input.\n**setosa**: Iris setosa, true or false, used as target.\n**versicolour**: Iris versicolour, true or false, used as target.\n**virginica**: Iris virginica, true or false, used as target.\n\n**<< Note >>**\n> You must answer the following question:\nHow does your company expact to use and benfit from your model.\n<br>\n[go to top](#top)"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"dee35ee214871c7c9d22104aafc6587eb3d2aa1e"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"11\"></a> <br>\n## 6- Inputs & Outputs\n<a id=\"12\"></a> <br>\n### 6-1 Inputs\n**Iris** is a very popular **classification** and **clustering** problem in machine learning and it is such as \"Hello world\" program when you start learning a new programming language. then I decided to apply Iris on  20 machine learning method on it.\nThe Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a **multivariate data set** introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis. It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers in three related species. Two of the three species were collected in the Gaspé Peninsula \"all from the same pasture, and picked on the same day and measured at the same time by the same person with the same apparatus\".\nThe data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other.\n\nAs a result, **iris dataset is used as the input of all algorithms**.\n<a id=\"13\"></a> <br>\n### 6-2 Outputs\nthe outputs for our algorithms totally depend on the type of classification or clustering algorithms.\nthe outputs can be the number of clusters or predict for new input.\n\n**setosa**: Iris setosa, true or false, used as target.\n**versicolour**: Iris versicolour, true or false, used as target.\n**virginica**: Iris virginica, true or false, used as a target.\n<br>\n[go to top](#top)"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"18e6a0730989363caa069a745b5f3ea8b30766e9"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"###### <a id=\"14\"></a> <br>\n## 7- Import packages"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"5b8aa15d1b11789c38f1dd19d5f06e4be054e525","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.metrics import classification_report\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import PCA\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom pandas import get_dummies\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nfrom sklearn import datasets\nimport plotly.plotly as py\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport xgboost as xgb\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib\nimport warnings\nimport sklearn\nimport scipy\nimport numpy\nimport json\nimport sys\nimport csv\nimport os","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"49d5cacd5d0aeadd10836b930cdb43e0ed581a60","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"print('matplotlib: {}'.format(matplotlib.__version__))\nprint('sklearn: {}'.format(sklearn.__version__))\nprint('scipy: {}'.format(scipy.__version__))\nprint('seaborn: {}'.format(sns.__version__))\nprint('pandas: {}'.format(pd.__version__))\nprint('numpy: {}'.format(np.__version__))\nprint('Python: {}'.format(sys.version))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":false,"trusted":true,"_uuid":"3fe93eb33b3c1499d10da8d9840e13ac29cb64d5"},"cell_type":"code","source":"warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\nsns.set(color_codes=True)\nplt.style.available\n%matplotlib inline\n%precision 2","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"e5c5a1da5ce973e4dce69388b76022b5f69e4c16"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"15\"></a> <br>\n## 7-1 Data Collection\n**Data collection** is the process of gathering and measuring data, information or any variables of interest in a standardized and established manner that enables the collector to answer or test hypothesis and evaluate outcomes of the particular collection.[techopedia]\n\n**Iris dataset**  consists of 3 different types of irises’ (Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica) petal and sepal length, stored in a 150x4 numpy.ndarray\n\nThe rows being the samples and the columns being: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length and Petal Width.[6]\n<br>\n[go to top](#top)"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"1f4c3ec8ecd51cc0ae810666af8f93d6d1d27aaf","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"# import Dataset to play with it\ndataset = pd.read_csv('../input/iris-dataset/Iris.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"a6db3370c16c7e91d1d1624bc88a35cde1f8f141"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**<< Note 1 >>**\n\n* Each row is an observation (also known as : sample, example, instance, record)\n* Each column is a feature (also known as: Predictor, attribute, Independent Variable, input, regressor, Covariate)"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"72cc7c7b60a33390a85b16bc34e3b9e424650cdd"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"16\"></a> <br>\n## 8- Model Deployment\nIn this section have been applied more than **20 learning algorithms** that play an important rule in your experiences and improve your knowledge in case of ML technique.\n\n> **<< Note 3 >>** : The results shown here may be slightly different for your analysis because, for example, the neural network algorithms use random number generators for fixing the initial value of the weights (starting points) of the neural networks, which often result in obtaining slightly different (local minima) solutions each time you run the analysis.
