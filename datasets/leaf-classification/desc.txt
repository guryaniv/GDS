There are estimated to be nearly half a million species of plant in the world.
Classification of species has been historically problematic and often results
in duplicate identifications. Automating plant recognition might have many
applications, including: The objective of this playground competition is to
use binary leaf images and extracted features, including shape, margin &
texture, to accurately identify 99 species of plants. Leaves, due to their
volume, prevalence, and unique characteristics, are an effective means of
differentiating plant species. They also provide a fun introduction to
applying techniques that involve image-based features. As a first step, try
building a classifier that uses the provided pre-extracted features. Next, try
creating a set of your own features. Finally, examine the errors you're making
and see what you can do to improve. Acknowledgments Kaggle is hosting this
competition for the data science community to use for fun and education. This
dataset originates from leaf images collected by James Cope, Thibaut Beghin,
Paolo Remagnino, & Sarah Barman of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, UK. Charles
