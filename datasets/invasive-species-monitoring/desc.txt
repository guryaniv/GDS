Tangles of kudzu overwhelm trees in Georgia while cane toads threaten habitats
in over a dozen countries worldwide. These are just two invasive species of
many which can have damaging effects on the environment, the economy, and even
human health. Despite widespread impact, efforts to track the location and
spread of invasive species are so costly that theyâ€™re difficult to undertake
at scale. Currently, ecosystem and plant distribution monitoring depends on
expert knowledge. Trained scientists visit designated areas and take note of
the species inhabiting them. Using such a highly qualified workforce is
expensive, time inefficient, and insufficient since humans cannot cover large
areas when sampling. Because scientists cannot sample a large quantity of
areas, some machine learning algorithms are used in order to predict the
presence or absence of invasive species in areas that have not been sampled.
The accuracy of this approach is far from optimal, but still contributes to
approaches to solving ecological problems. In this playground competition,
Kagglers are challenged to develop algorithms to more accurately identify
whether images of forests and foliage contain invasive hydrangea or not.
Techniques from computer vision alongside other current technologies like
aerial imaging can make invasive species monitoring cheaper, faster, and more
reliable. Acknowledgments Data providers: Christian Requena Mesa, Thore Engel,
