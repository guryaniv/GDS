In this sense, this user should not have any purchase at all. This is very well reflected by the training data and at first I thought the model should be able to pick this up easily. Howerver, after some experiments I failed to use this feature in any meaningful way. That's why I tried to use this to do some postprocessing. \n\nI acutally expected a boost more than 0.0001,  as half of the records in test have positive bounces. But it seems my model has already done a decent job dealing with these cases.
