This informs the Plotly's plotting function of the type of plots that need to be drawn. It is basically a list of plots that should be part of the chart. Each plot within the chart is referred to as a 'trace'.\n\nLayout - this represents everything in the chart that is not data. This means the background, grids, axes, titles, fonts, etc. We can even add shapes on top of the chart and annotations to highlight certain points to the user.\n\nThe data and layout are then passed to a \"figure\" object, which is in turn passed to the plot function in Plotly.\n\n- Figure\n    - Data\n        - Traces\n    - Layout\n        - Layout options"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8786ee011d449e47645605f00a34a674a4baf875"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Scatterplots\nIn Plotly, the Scatter function is used for scatterplots, line plots and bubble charts.
