With over 1,200 quick service restaurants across the globe, TFI is the company
behind some of the world's most well-known brands: Burger King, Sbarro,
Popeyes, Usta Donerci, and Arbyâ€™s. They employ over 20,000 people in Europe
and Asia and make significant daily investments in developing new restaurant
sites. Right now, deciding when and where to open new restaurants is largely a
subjective process based on the personal judgement and experience of
development teams. This subjective data is difficult to accurately extrapolate
across geographies and cultures. New restaurant sites take large investments
of time and capital to get up and running. When the wrong location for a
restaurant brand is chosen, the site closes within 18 months and operating
losses are incurred. Finding a mathematical model to increase the
effectiveness of investments in new restaurant sites would allow TFI to invest
more in other important business areas, like sustainability, innovation, and
training for new employees. Using demographic, real estate, and commercial
data, this competition challenges you to predict the annual restaurant sales
of 100,000 regional locations. TFI would love to hire an expert Kaggler like
you to head up their growing data science team in Istanbul or Shanghai. You'd
be tackling problems like the one featured in this competition on a global
scale. See the job description here >>
