Something definitely worth exploring, which could boost the performance of the XGBoost model significantly, is to create a data set that can be used with [Xiaolin Wu's line algorithm](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiaolin_Wu%27s_line_algorithm \"Xiaolin Wu's line algorithm\"). This would involve pixelating the graph area and recording every pixel crossed by the line from the pick-up location to the drop-off location. If you can make the resolution as high as possible some of the pixels shoudl encapsulate traffic junctions, traffic lights, bridges, etc. Using the \"has crossed coordinate X\" features one could potentially create an extra +-10 000 features to train the alogrithm with.</p><br>\n", "\n", "<p>**Note:** XGBoost will be able to handle up to about 10 000 columns (features) with about 1 million rows of data on a Mac Book Pro.</p>"], "metadata": {"_uuid": "f764544ed5ed9112024c12498f5c14525f073dcd", "_cell_guid": "a2428383-6fc5-4564-b89f-3b132228d6e5"}, "cell_type": "markdown"}, {"source": ["<h2>4.

The reason for this is to be able to tweak model parameters to increase accuracy (i.e. decrease the root mean square error [RSME] value) without creating bias towards the test set. Also, and perhaps more importantly, is that we need a validation set to use with XGBoost. So the XGBoost algorithm takes three datasets: a training set, a test set, and a validation set. The validation set is used to continuously evaluate the accuracy of the training model, and finally the model is used to make predictions against the test set.

XGBoost - Training the Model and Testing the Accuracy</h2>\n", "-------------------------------------------------------\n", "\n", "<p>As mentioned you can play with the different parameters of the XGBoost algorithm to tweak the model's outcome. So below is a short, but very nice, way of itterating through model parameters to tweak the model. So it's implementation is simple: just uncomment the code and run the kernel. Again, refer to the [documentation for XGBoost](http://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/python_intro.html \"XGBoost Documentation\") to understand what each parameter does and how it alters the behaviour of the training process.</p>"], "metadata": {"_uuid": "f5cf17c818de4d2412bbbdb769bcbf9ec3e590d5", "_cell_guid": "6363edbd-7db5-4e3f-8412-37f2050ac942"}, "cell_type": "markdown"}, {"execution_count": null, "metadata": {"collapsed": true, "_uuid": "58b9961a53a16766409e8abb29de58c1d59ee7e8", "_cell_guid": "3c2c21f7-32af-4bbd-be24-75a43a0c800b"}, "outputs": [], "source": ["#md = [6]\n", "#lr = [0.1,0.3]\n", "#mcw = [20,25,30]\n", "#for m in md:\n", "#    for l in lr:\n", "#        for n in mcw:\n", "#            t0 = datetime.now()\n", "#            xgb_pars = {'min_child_weight': mcw, 'eta': lr, 'colsample_bytree': 0.9, \n", "#                        'max_depth': md,\n", "#            'subsample': 0.9, 'lambda': 1., 'nthread': -1, 'booster' : 'gbtree', 'silent': 1,\n", "#            'eval_metric': 'rmse', 'objective': 'reg:linear'}\n", "#            model = xgb.train(xgb_pars, dtrain, 50, watchlist, early_stopping_rounds=10,\n", "#                  maximize=False, verbose_eval=1)"], "cell_type": "code"}, {"source": ["[0]\ttrain-rmse:5.70042\tvalid-rmse:5.69993\n", "Multiple eval metrics have been passed: 'valid-rmse' will be used for early stopping.\n", "\n", "Will train until valid-rmse hasn't improved in 10 rounds.\n", "\n", "*[11]\ttrain-rmse: 3.25699\tvalid-rmse: 3.25698 <br>\n", "... <br>\n", "... <br>\n", "\n", "[89]\ttrain-rmse:0.335358\tvalid-rmse:0.345624 <br>\n", "[90]\ttrain-rmse:0.334614\tvalid-rmse:0.344972 <br>\n", "[91]\ttrain-rmse:0.333921\tvalid-rmse:0.344405 <br>"], "metadata": {"_uuid": "39eebbf7d65031decfac0e8981c037bd158e9543", "_cell_guid": "73835056-7354-45e2-b462-491d5573b442"}, "cell_type": "markdown"}, {"source": ["Here is one for the fork's.
