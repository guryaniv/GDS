Markov chains are a remarkably simple yet powerful tool that can be applied in a wide range of contexts, such as dertermining the importance of webpages, chemical kinetics, and text generation. A Markov process can be considered a random walk, where each step is independent of the previous one. More formally, it is a stochastic process in which state changes are probabilistic and which future states depend on the current state only. \n\nHere, a simple Markov chain is constructed from the set of wine reviews to generate your own wine review; simply provide country and variety.  Included is a function to filter the full set of wine reviews to be  specific to a given country and variety - also correcting any mispelling - and filtering out wines with too few reviews.  The data set is not explored as there are plenty other excellent kernels that do that for this data set.\n\nOne possible use for this function is to make yourself sound more fancy when commenting on wine. Perfect for use on a date, formal dinner, or even wine tasting.\n\nEdit: Replaced nltk edit distance with fuzzywuzzy for improved accuracy of spell-checking."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory\n\nimport os\nprint(os.listdir(\"../input\"))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":4,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","collapsed":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nfrom numpy import argmax\nfrom re import match\nfrom nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\nfrom random import choice\nfrom fuzzywuzzy import process","execution_count":15,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"c6c5bb05-e714-4160-821a-7b9a7db244f4","_uuid":"d365c020636b04d044e572e4ebe0fea50908227c","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# =============================================================================\n# load and filter data\n# =============================================================================\ndata = pd.read_csv('../input/winemag-data-130k-v2.csv')\ndata = data.filter(items=['country','variety','description'])\n\n# Further filter for country and variety such that only those with greater than 1000 samples remain\ndf_dummy = data.groupby('country').filter(lambda x: len(x) > 1000)\nfilteredData = df_dummy.groupby('variety').filter(lambda x: len(x) > 1000)\n\n# Output lists of countries and varieties with sufficient number of samples in original data\nprint(\"Countries you can choose from include: \\n{}\".format(list(filteredData.country.unique())))\nprint(\"\\nVarieties you can choose from include: \\n{}\".format(list(filteredData.variety.unique())))\n","execution_count":16,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"2db2d87c-327f-4b9a-ab0f-9220d12fb723","_uuid":"82219cf82cdc46c13432977e8463585ecf1f7790","collapsed":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# =============================================================================\n# To correct for inaccurate spelling of certain wine varieties, function \n# `mineText' determines variety and country to be that most closely matching \n# your input - using function edit_distance.
