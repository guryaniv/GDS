The version which scores 1514637.06 is [#36](https://www.kaggle.com/ppershing/lkh-bootstrap-rust-fine-tuning?scriptVersionId=9206685). As you can see, we run a lots of different configurations in order to get to this result. In general, we have a problem with high variance when re-running the same configuration can yiled scores different up to 100 just depending on the random chance (I guess we end up falling into steep local minimum)\n\n1) Initial tour finding. We use [LKH 3](http://akira.ruc.dk/~keld/research/LKH-3/) to find an initial path. We use custom config which was fine-tuned to produce a raw solution (without problem specific penalty) worth of 15002800 in about one hour. We run 4 parallel instances of LKH with different seeds to have different paths\n\n2) Push tour even further. We use second round of 4 LKHs, this time fine-tuned to quickly take previous solutions and improve them a bit. We run this for another almost full hour to gain raw solutions worth of about 15002740. This gives a penalty scores of about 1516400.\n\n3) Recombine solulutions. We use custom C++ implementation of LKH's IPT crossover operator. Note that this implementation is customized to account for penalty but we ignore penalty in this stage.\n\n4) Run main optimalization technique. This is written in Rust  (not included in the Kernel file, downloaded externally as we were chaining it a lot). We run the main technique in several steps, slowly increasing penalty from 0.0 to 0.1 during the course of 4 kernel hours (Note: We first thought that the kernel runtime is 6 hours. In reality it is 9 but it probably would not help much).\n\nA bit more details about Rust code can be found here [Our solution for 2nd place](https://www.kaggle.com/c/traveling-santa-2018-prime-paths/discussion/77250). In general, we do ~15 minute steps with 2 optimization threads + 2 kick threads, then ~15 minutes of 1 opt + 3 kick and then we increase penalty (schedule is in the last cell)"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
