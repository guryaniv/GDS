Introduction**\n\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/NmskNuo.jpg)\n\n**PUBG (Player Unknown's Battlegrounds)** is a hugely successful and popular online shooter game. It's of so called \"battle royale\" type - the game ends when the last team stays alive on a map.  The difference to the normal deathmatch is that after you are killed in battle royale game you're not re-spawned anymore (perma-death). Here is the [official game site](https://www.pubg.com/).\nAt the moment this competition was launched there were only two maps: \"Erangel\" and \"Miramar\". Currently there is \"Vikendi\" as well but it is not in our dataset.\n\nThere were few datasets regarding this game on Kaggle before. If you want for example to see my non-parametric Survival Analysis (Kaplan-Meier) click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datark1/pubg-survival-analysis-kaplan-meier).\n\nThis kernel is mostly EDA oriented but we will look for some anomalies as well ( possibly cheaters).\n\n**2.
