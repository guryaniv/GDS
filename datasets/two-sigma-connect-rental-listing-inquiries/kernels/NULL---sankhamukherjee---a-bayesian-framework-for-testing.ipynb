Let us say that we have a bunch of models $\\mathbf{m} = [m_0, m_1, \\ldots, m_{N-1}]$. Then, each of these models can give us a bunch of predictions on the testing data $\\mathbf{\\hat{P}}(H_i)$.

        "We have seen in this article how we can incorporate machine learning models into a Bayesian Framework. The good news about this framework is that this is going to work well no matter what type of model you use, how different they are. In fact, because of the assumption of independence, the more different your models are, the better off you will be. The other interesting thing about this approach is that this method os going to change your prior *in proportion* to how good they are. So if a particular model is very accurate, then this method should theoretically enhance that. \n",
