Submissions are evaluated using the multi-class logarithmic loss. Each pronoun
has been labeled with whether it refers to A, B, or NEITHER. For each pronoun,
you must submit a set of predicted probabilities (one for each class). The
formula is then, logloss=− 1 N ∑ i=1 N ∑ j=1 M y ij log( p ij ), where N is
the number of samples in the test set, M is 3, log l is the natural logarithm,
y ij y is 1 if observation i i belongs to class j j and 0 otherwise, and p ij
p is the predicted probability that observation i i belongs to class j j . The
submitted probabilities are not required to sum to one because they are
rescaled prior to being scored (each row is divided by the row sum). In order
to avoid the extremes of the log function, predicted probabilities are
replaced with max(min(p,1− 10 −15 ), 10 −15 ) m . Submission File You must
submit a csv file with the probabilities that a pronoun refers to A, B, or
NEITHER. The order of the rows does not matter. The file must have a header
and should look like the following: ID,A,B,NEITHER
