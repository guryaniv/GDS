# Workflow Stage Classifier

Our task in this stage (in the Classification directory) is to classify Jupyter notebook cells into the relevant Data-Science workflow stage, as described in the [documentation](https://github.com/guryaniv/GDS/blob/master/Documentation/Worklow_Stage_Classifier_Documentation.pdf).

There are two notebooks:
* [Exploration_and_WeakSupervision](https://github.com/guryaniv/GDS/blob/master/Classification/Exploration_and_WeakSupervision.ipynb) - as the name implies it contains our data exploration and tagging of the unlabeled data using snorkel weak supervision. The input is a parsed tsv file with the cells' code and relavant data, see [data_gathering](https://github.com/TAU-DB/guided-ds/tree/master/data_gathering) for more info. <br>
This notebook will automatically open the second notebook.
* [Classification](https://github.com/guryaniv/GDS/blob/master/Classification/Classification.ipynb) - this notebook contains our end-classification-model (LSTM) which is thw workflow stage classifier itself. The input for this model is the tagged data, with labels that were generated by snorkel in the previous notebook.  



*If you are only intrested in the end-model you may start with the second notebook*

**Note** - snorkel.db, LSTM.h5 and the checkpoints folder enable you to load already existing database and trained model and skip long executions. Follow the instructions in the notebooks.
