We want to estimate what accuracy we can expect on the test set, where we do not know the ground truth labels.  We want a *realistic* score however. In fact, we would rather have a slightly pessimistic score, over a very optimistic score.  If we structure our cross-validation properly, we should get a very close estimate of what we should expect on unseen data.\n", "\n", "Preventing an overly-optimistic score requires careful thoughts about potential sources of data leakage.  Data leakage occurs where steps in your model building process essentially transfer knowledge about the ground truth labels of training set data to, assumed pure representation of unseen data, test sets.  It is very easy to cause this leakage without realizing you are doing it.  *ANY* step along your way from raw data -> model should be suspect.  You should always ask yourself if what you are doing has any abilty to optimisitically bias your hold out test sets during cross validation.\n", "\n", "There are several sources of data leakage and they have varying degrees of influence on your overall score, but here are some main areas that are often overlooked:\n", "\n", "1.  Pre-processing.  Almost all data will require some pre-processing.  Let's think about what that usually involves.  First we want to deal with missing data.  That will require imputation based on the filled in data if we want to use certain classifiers such as SVMs..  But, if we impute the missing value from the entire training set, we are transferring knowledge about the entire dataset to that missing value, and hence to that sample.  That could positively bias any sample with a missing value.  If the data is skewed, that could positively influence those samples if the samples are from the same class as the positively skewed class.   It will not matter then if you cross validate, as these sample will end up in your test sets, and they carry with them information about samples in your training sets.  This is a more minor concern, but we could definitely get unlucky here and create real optimisitic bias in our model built on our entire training data. The same problems occur with other common pre-processing techniques, such as: Feature Selection using techniques such as Decision Trees or Mutual Information, or Dimensionality Reduction using something like PCA or LDA.\n", "\n", "2.  Oversampling minority classes to ameliorate the skew in your data.  This is generally done by an algorithm such as SMOTE, or by replication of classes in the minority class.  This is technically still pre-processing, but you should be able to see why this is a much more serious source of data leakage.  If you are replicating data, even if it is randomly generated based on existing data, you are introducing samples that *heavily* carry information about other samples in that class.  If you try this on heavily skewed data, you will of course instantly get amazing scores.... that mean absolutely nothing in the real world of unseen data.\n", "\n", "3.  Hyperparameter Tuning.  Of course we want to separate our data into folds, so that we can have a cross validation set to test our built models.  However, we also want to tune our model's hyperparameters.  Most classifer models of interest require some hyperparameter tuning, especially for regularization.  So, we will need *ANOTHER* cross validation, inside our first cross validation, to prevent the test set data from leaking into our hyperparameter tuning.  Can you see why?\n", "\n", "If we want to grid search the parameters of our model, we will need to cross validate.  We hold out a test set, we try one set of parameters on the grid, and we score.  We repeat that for our K-folds, and then move onto the next point on the grid.  In the end we get a cross validated score of each grid point.  Then we pick the best grid point and we are good to go, right?  *NO*  We are definitely not good to go.  Because our hyper parameter search involved the entire training set on each grid point, samples are in and out of the training fold on each grid point and the choice of hyperparameters is being tuned and evaluated with the same data.\n", "\n", "Hence, we need to nest two folds of cross validation.  The outer CV holds out a test fold and passes on K-1 training folds for model building .  The inner CV operates on the K-1 folds training set from the outer CV.  The inner CV hold out another test set and passes on another K-1 training folds to the model tuning grid search in turn as described above.  This way we are getting a realistic view of completely naive data on each outer CV fold.\n", "\n", "The downside to all of this of course is that, from preprocessing to hyper parameter tuning, we are always calculating on less that the full data.  Such is life.  This gives us a slighly more pessimistic score than we would expect to realize on unseen data when we ultimately end up creating our final model on the entire training set.  Yep, that is right.  Once we are done evaluating our model, we will of course refit our model to the entire dataset to maximize our score on unseen data.  We just have no way of actually knowing how much better this score will be than the one we just estimated using our nested CV.\n", "\n", "Fortunately, sklearn makes all of this extremely easy to implement in practice.

We can try the ever popular XGBoost.  We can try deeper grid searches.  We can try stacking.  We can likely eek out a few more % in this data, but I have read that it maxes out around 84% using exhaustive searches with the techniques presented here.  The TSNE evaluation appears to agree with this assessment.  Feature engineering will likely be needed to push this data past 84%, if it is possible at all.\n", "\n", "That being said, let's build our final model.\n", "\n"]}, {"outputs": [], "cell_type": "code", "metadata": {"_cell_guid": "79c21e8a-cd1d-4c64-b10a-5d6c11451b9d", "_uuid": "696371998811924505cf3d2c4e0a45dffa02967d", "collapsed": true}, "execution_count": null, "source": ["clf_svm.fit(X, y)"]}, {"outputs": [], "cell_type": "code", "metadata": {"_cell_guid": "77b8a536-e8a4-4864-98e5-9b9b182810e9", "_uuid": "829b8f577f805fa4616ef123150a8c4b1de6cfe2", "collapsed": true}, "execution_count": null, "source": ["# And predict\n", "ypred_test = clf_svm.predict(Xt)\n", "\n", "ypred_test"]}, {"outputs": [], "cell_type": "code", "metadata": {"_cell_guid": "28752ad3-04a8-43b3-af50-0b876de4f55a", "_uuid": "6da32d0dc0ebb666bcb2f03156680c865346fd13", "collapsed": true}, "execution_count": null, "source": ["# And save in the proper format\n", "# One column each of PassengerId\tSurvived\n", "data = pd.DataFrame(df_test['PassengerId'])\n", "\n", "data['Survived'] = ypred_test\n", "\n", "data.to_csv('submission_svm.csv', index=False)"]}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"language": "python", "name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3"}, "language_info": {"version": "3.6.4", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "name": "python", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3"}}, "nbformat_minor": 1, "nbformat": 4}
