In this kernel I'd like to explore the Concorde TSP solver mixed with a path flip approach to optimize for the prime portion of this competition as [Matthew Anderson explores in his Flip It kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/matthewa313/flip-it).\n\n**NOTE:** in order for this to work you'll need to import the \"jvkersch/pyconcorde\" GitHub repo using the option in the notebook editor called \"Packages\". This GibHub package is a Python wrapper around the original C code written as the \"Concorde TSP Solver\".
