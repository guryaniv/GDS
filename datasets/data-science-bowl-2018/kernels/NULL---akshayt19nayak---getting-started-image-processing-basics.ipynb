Transforming the colorspace removes all color information, leaving only the luminance of each pixel. Since digital images are displayed using a combination of red, green, and blue (RGB) colors, each pixel has three separate luminance values.

Our job here is to seperate the two, that is, seperate the nuclei from the background. The optimal seperation value is somewhere around 20 but rather than relying on such descriptive statistics, we should take a more formal approach such as using Otsu's method.\nOtsu's method, named after Nobuyuki Otsu is used to automatically perform clustering-based image thresholding, or, the reduction of a graylevel image to a binary image. The algorithm assumes that the image contains two classes of pixels following bi-modal histogram (foreground pixels and background pixels), it then calculates the optimum threshold separating the two classes so that their combined spread (intra-class variance) is minimal, or equivalently, so that their inter-class variance is maximal. Otsu’s method exhibits relatively good performance if the histogram can be assumed to have bimodal distribution and assumed to possess a deep and sharp valley between two peaks (source : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otsu%27s_method) ","outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8de96e891bccdf041636785699450acdbfe62589","_cell_guid":"f0818f3d-09e3-42f4-a957-e71113eac096","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from skimage.filters import threshold_otsu\nthresh_val = threshold_otsu(grayimg)\nprint('The optimal seperation value is',thresh_val)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8ba94cc2e0254cd275603f0b1d8902567e9fe11d","_cell_guid":"3e69d253-0073-48a4-b9f2-b2a1afe9ee9c"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now we'll use the np.where function to encode all pixels with an intensity value > the threshold value as 1 and all other pixels as 0.

Any layer of complexity that we add onto this should better this score, failing which it is absolutely useless.\n\nSome important questions to ask are:\n\n- Will we achieve a satisfactory performance by converting all pictures to grayscale? What are the different types of pictures in the dataset?\n- What are the numerous ways to seperate the background from objects of interest? Otsu's method requires computing a graylevel histogram for us to find the optimum seperation value. In that respect KMeans may work better on images that aren't particularly grayscale or on images where there is no sharp contrast in the intensity values between objects of interest and the background\n- What are some useful edge detection algorithms to create boundaries between nuclei that are extremely close to one another?\n- How do we as humans identify objects in an image?
