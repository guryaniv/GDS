Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer Had some very tired hooves But he had a job to
finish Could he do it with the shortest moves? All of the other reindeer Used
to laugh and mock his code They always said poor Rudolph Couldn't handle the
workload Then one foggy Christmas Eve Santa came to say I see you've taken
number theory Please make this night a bit less dreary? Then how the reindeer
loved him and each enrolled in an AI degree Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer We
get to go to bed early! Rudolph has always believed in working smarter, not
harder. And what better way to earn the respect of Comet and Blitzen than
showing the initiative to improve Santa's annual route for delivering toys on
Christmas Eve? This year, Rudolph believes he can motivate the overworked
Reindeer team by wisely choosing the order in which they visit the houses on
Santa's list. The houses in prime cities always leave carrots for the
Reindeers alongside the usual cookies and milk. These carrots are just the
sustenance the Reindeers need to keep pace. In fact, Rudolph has found that if
the Reindeer team doesn't originate from a prime city exactly every 10th step,
it takes the 10% longer than it normally would to make their next destination!
Can you help Rudolph solve the Traveling Santa problem subject to his carrot
constraint? His team--and Santa--are counting on you! Attributions: Reindeer
