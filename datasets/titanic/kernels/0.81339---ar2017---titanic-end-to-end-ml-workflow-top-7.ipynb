The objective of this kernel is to show the comprehensive workflow of building predictive models by using machine learning tools. The workflow includes:\n1. **Problem Definition**: Without a correct understanding about the problem we face, we will not be able to apply the appropriate solution to the problem. A clear definition of the problem enables us to identify the appropriate data to gather and technique(s) to use in order to solve the problem. \n2. **Data Gathering**: Data is the lifeblood of predictive analytics. We have to know which data to use, where to gather them, and how to make them useful to solve our problem. \n3. **Data Wrangling**: Raw data are generally incomplete, inconsistent, and contain many errors. Thus, we need to prepare the data for further processing. Data wrangling is the process of cleaning, structuring, and enriching raw data into another format with the intent of making it more appropriate and valuable for a variety of downstream purposes, such as analytics.\n4. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an approach of performing initial investigations on our data. EDA normally has descriptive nature and uses graphical statistics to discover patterns, to identify anomalies, to test hypothesis, and to check assumptions regarding our data. \n5. **Data Modelling**: There is no machine learning algorithm that works best in all situations. So, the best approach is to generate a high performance model is by trying multiple algorithms, optimizing them, and comparing them for your specific scenario. Data modelling involves selecting and optiming the machine learning models that generate the best predictive performance based on the data we have. \n6. **Prediction**: Once we have developed the best predictive model, we can deploy it to make predictions. \n\nI have tried to keep the notebook as basic as possible so that even newbies can understand every phase of it. If you think this notebook gives something valuable to your journey to data science, PLEASE UPVOTE. It will keep me motivated."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"f0130877a8b690ffd78231f0bd61546c87f4d05e"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Table of Contents\n- [**1.0.

Problem Definition\nThe sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.\n\nOne of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\n\nIn this challenge, we are to perform analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.\n\nBefore moving to the next section, we need to import all packages required to do the analysis by calling the following:"},{"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"trusted":false,"_uuid":"d25f6484a305be39728b0d8ac720d1901b0dd1fd"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Importing data analysis packages\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Importing data visualization packages\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\nsns.set(style=\"whitegrid\")\n\n# Importing feature selection packages\nfrom sklearn.feature_selection import RFECV\n\n# Importing model selection packages\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedShuffleSplit, cross_validate, GridSearchCV, cross_val_score\n\n# Importing machine learning packages\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression, LogisticRegression, RidgeClassifier, SGDClassifier, PassiveAggressiveClassifier\nfrom sklearn.gaussian_process import GaussianProcessClassifier\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC, LinearSVC, NuSVC \nfrom sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier, RadiusNeighborsClassifier\nfrom sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB, MultinomialNB, BernoulliNB, ComplementNB\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier, BaggingClassifier, ExtraTreesClassifier, VotingClassifier\nfrom sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier\nfrom xgboost import XGBClassifier\n\n# Miscellaneous\nimport time\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\npd.set_option('max_colwidth',80)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"62817c47c04fc4506a6a2c51fcfd0541279c125b"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='section 2.0.'></a>"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"287cfab8a444820ebfe7d67fbb6c6bd978f25f78"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 2.0.

Model Optimization with Feature Selection\nFeature selection is the process to select features that contribute the most to the output feature we are interested in.

This [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/why-how-and-when-to-apply-feature-selection-e9c69adfabf2) by Sudharsan Asaithambi discuss various types of feature selection. \n\nIn this problem, we use recursive feature elimination with cross validation (RFECV) for selecting features. A detail explanation about [RFECV](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_selection.html) can be read here.
