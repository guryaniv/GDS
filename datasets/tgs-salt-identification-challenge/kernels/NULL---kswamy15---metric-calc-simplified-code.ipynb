I have used this metric code in my DL model and every submission result has come very close to what I came up for my validation data using this code.  This metric code is based on my understanding of the metric from the discussion here:\n\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/c/tgs-salt-identification-challenge/discussion/62717\n\nand the notebook here:\n\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/pestipeti/explanation-of-scoring-metric\n\nNote: The script assumes that your ground truth and predicted masks have values 0 to 1.
