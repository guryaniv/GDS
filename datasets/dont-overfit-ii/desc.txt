Long ago, in the distant, fragrant mists of time, there was a competition...
It was not just any competition. It was a competition that challenged mere
mortals to model a 20,000x200 matrix of continuous variables using only 250
training samples... without overfitting. Data scientists ― including Kaggle's
very own Will Cukierski ― competed by the hundreds. Legends were made. (Will
took 5th place, and eventually ended up working at Kaggle!) People overfit
like crazy. It was a Kaggle-y, data science-y madhouse. So... we're doing it
again. Don't Overfit II: The Overfittening This is the next logical step in
the evolution of weird competitions. Once again we have 20,000 rows of
continuous variables, and a mere handful of training samples. Once again, we
challenge you not to overfit. Do your best, model without overfitting, and
add, perhaps, to your own legend. In addition to bragging rights, the winner
also gets swag. Enjoy! Acknowledgments We hereby salute the hard work that
went into the original competition, created by Phil Brierly. Thank you!
