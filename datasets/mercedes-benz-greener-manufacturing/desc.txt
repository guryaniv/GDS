Since the first automobile, the Benz Patent Motor Car in 1886, Mercedes-Benz
has stood for important automotive innovations. These include, for example,
the passenger safety cell with crumple zone, the airbag and intelligent
assistance systems. Mercedes-Benz applies for nearly 2000 patents per year,
making the brand the European leader among premium car makers. Daimler’s
Mercedes-Benz cars are leaders in the premium car industry. With a huge
selection of features and options, customers can choose the customized
Mercedes-Benz of their dreams. . To ensure the safety and reliability of each
and every unique car configuration before they hit the road, Daimler’s
engineers have developed a robust testing system. But, optimizing the speed of
their testing system for so many possible feature combinations is complex and
time-consuming without a powerful algorithmic approach. As one of the world’s
biggest manufacturers of premium cars, safety and efficiency are paramount on
Daimler’s production lines. In this competition, Daimler is challenging
Kagglers to tackle the curse of dimensionality and reduce the time that cars
spend on the test bench. Competitors will work with a dataset representing
different permutations of Mercedes-Benz car features to predict the time it
takes to pass testing. Winning algorithms will contribute to speedier testing,
resulting in lower carbon dioxide emissions without reducing Daimler’s
standards.
