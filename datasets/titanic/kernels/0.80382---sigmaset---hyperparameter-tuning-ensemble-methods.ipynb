This code gives you slightly more than 80% accuracy.\n\n# Step 2: Creating a Validation Set \n\nWe use the validation set to test out the performance of the training models. The simplest way to create a validation set is to use train_test_split function and specify the percentage of data that you would want to allocate for validation. This will splits the training data into two sets of training and validation. For example, the code below creates a validation set with 20% of the data.\n\ntrain_set, validation_set, survival_labels, validation_labels = train_test_split(train_data, train_data[\"Survived\"], test_size=0.20, random_state=42)\n\nNow that you know the simple way, let's apply a more sophisticated split that tries to preserve the distribution of the features we care more about. This is particularly helpful in situation where an expert tells you a feature is more important than others, or you run a set of feature importance analysis and realize one or two categories are more important than the others. Dont worry about the feature importance for now. we will revisit in step 4. Based on my analysis, Fare and Age are the highest correlated features to survival. \n\nI used StratifiedShuffleSplit applied on 'age' to ensure my validation set has a similar distribution to the initial training set with respect to age.
