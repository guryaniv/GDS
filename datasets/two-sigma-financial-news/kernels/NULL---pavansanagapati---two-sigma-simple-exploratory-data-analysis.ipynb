The ubiquity of data today enables investors at any scale to make better investment decisions. The challenge is ingesting and interpreting the data to determine which data is useful, finding the signal in this sea of information. Two Sigma is passionate about this challenge and is excited to share it with the Kaggle community.\n\nAs a scientifically driven investment manager, Two Sigma has been applying technology and data science to financial forecasts for over 17 years. Their pioneering advances in big data, AI, and machine learning have pushed the investment industry forward. Now, they're eager to engage with Kagglers in this continuing pursuit of innovation.\n\nBy analyzing news data to predict stock prices, Kagglers have a unique opportunity to advance the state of research in understanding the predictive power of the news. This power, if harnessed, could help predict financial outcomes and generate significant economic impact all over the world.\n\n## Data Description\n\nIn this competition, we need to predict future stock price returns based on two sources of data:\n\n**Market data (2007 to present) provided by Intrinio **\n\nIt contains financial market information such as opening price, closing price, trading volume, calculated returns, etc.\n\n**News data (2007 to present) Source: Thomson Reuters**\n\nIt  contains information about news articles/alerts published about assets, such as article details, sentiment, and other commentary.\n\n- Each asset is identified by an assetCode (note that a single company may have multiple assetCodes). Depending on what you wish to do, you may use the assetCode, assetName, or time as a way to join the market data to news data.\n\n## Data Mining\n\n**Important Note : **\n\nBefore we actually go into the details of market data and news data we will start with an data mining section to fetch the data from the Kaggle DataFrames provided as below \n\n### Import Libraries "},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"3cf24e5e4916804424a07bb0a94261ce2599f752","_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import plotly.offline as py\n\npy.init_notebook_mode(connected=True)\n\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\n\nimport plotly.tools as tls\n\nimport warnings\n\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n\nimport numpy as np \n\nimport pandas as pd ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"5935ebe2e72691aaa1cb57ddfd98b6edf34baa3d"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Data mine both market data and news data from Kaggle ."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from kaggle.competitions import twosigmanews\n\n#   You  can  only    call    make_env() once, so don't lose it!\n\nenv = twosigmanews.make_env()\n\nprint('Done!')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"67f1577cebc1d60c49397a7969840f5fab1186e9"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now let us call  **get_training_data** function from the new environment  which returns market training data and news training data dataFrames containing all market and news data from February 2007 to December 2016."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"c20fa6deeac9d374c98774abd90bdc76b023ee63"},"cell_type":"code","source":"(market_train_data, news_train_data) = env.get_training_data()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"2ede3716e979b5831245e998e100972b67f5a18f"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now let us explore the data in detail .Firstly lets look at Market Data .\n\n## Market data"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"e2eaea134bfe1f4af86afcaa26e1311d39f363a2"},"cell_type":"code","source":"market_train_data.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"6e349943cc34c29c4e9605d293e9986d5e1e9bc3"},"cell_type":"code","source":"market_train_data.shape","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"b628172be0107004784b383cc68323933379f46f"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The data includes a subset of US-listed instruments. The set of included instruments changes daily and is determined based on the amount traded and the availability of information. This means that there may be instruments that enter and leave this subset of data. There may therefore be gaps in the data provided, and this does not necessarily imply that that data does not exist (those rows are likely not included due to the selection criteria).\n\nThe marketdata contains a variety of returns calculated over different timespans. All of the returns in this set of marketdata have these properties:\n\n- Returns are always calculated either open-to-open (from the opening time of one trading day to the open of another) or close-to-close (from the closing time of one trading day to the open of another).\n- Returns are either raw, meaning that the data is not adjusted against any benchmark, or market-residualized (Mktres), meaning that the movement of the market as a whole has been accounted for, leaving only movements inherent to the instrument.\n- Returns can be calculated over any arbitrary interval. Provided here are 1 day and 10 day horizons.\n- Returns are tagged with 'Prev' if they are backwards looking in time, or 'Next' if forwards looking.\n\nWithin the marketdata, you will find the following columns:\n\n- time(datetime64[ns, UTC]) - the current time (in marketdata, all rows are taken at 22:00 UTC)\n- assetCode(object) - a unique id of an asset\n- assetName(category) - the name that corresponds to a group of assetCodes. These may be \"Unknown\" if the corresponding - assetCode does not have any rows in the news data.\n- universe(float64) - a boolean indicating whether or not the instrument on that day will be included in scoring. This value is not provided outside of the training data time period. The trading universe on a given date is the set of instruments that are avilable for trading (the scoring function will not consider instruments that are not in the trading universe). The trading universe changes daily.\n- volume(float64) - trading volume in shares for the day\n- close(float64) - the close price for the day (not adjusted for splits or dividends)\n- open(float64) - the open price for the day (not adjusted for splits or dividends)\n- returnsClosePrevRaw1(float64) - see returns explanation above\n- returnsOpenPrevRaw1(float64) - see returns explanation above\n- returnsClosePrevMktres1(float64) - see returns explanation above\n- returnsOpenPrevMktres1(float64) - see returns explanation above\n- returnsClosePrevRaw10(float64) - see returns explanation above\n- returnsOpenPrevRaw10(float64) - see returns explanation above\n- returnsClosePrevMktres10(float64) - see returns explanation above\n- returnsOpenPrevMktres10(float64) - see returns explanation above\n- returnsOpenNextMktres10(float64) - 10 day, market-residualized return. This is the target variable used in competition scoring. The market data has been filtered such that returnsOpenNextMktres10 is always not null.\n\n\nNow let us examine the market dataset to see if there are any null values by using a function"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"c8c2299a544fc215b939a23e1c573384505da154"},"cell_type":"code","source":"def missing_value_graph(data):\n    data = [\n    go.Bar(\n        x = data.columns,\n        y = data.isnull().sum(),\n        name = 'Unknown Asset Values',\n        textfont=dict(size=12),\n        marker=dict(\n        line=dict(\n            color='red',\n            width=1,\n        ), opacity = 0.55\n    )\n    ),\n    ]\n    layout= go.Layout(\n        title= '\"Total Missing Value By Feature\"',\n        xaxis= dict(title='Features', ticklen=5, zeroline=False, gridwidth=2),\n        yaxis=dict(title='Value Count', ticklen=5, gridwidth=2),\n        showlegend=True\n    )\n    fig= go.Figure(data=data, layout=layout)\n    py.iplot(fig, filename='skin')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"3c460ffac5955193e0ecea975aa7bebd5ade9e68"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"    Let us now plot the missing values in market train dataset."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"8c9aa53f6044ffc313322f7d65356f4aafee3b77"},"cell_type":"code","source":"missing_value_graph(market_train_data)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"ffccc5476ee3dcff57af6fcd9ed49c4f546ee13a"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now let us explore the news train dataset in detail .\n# News Data"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"05522420ce14337c0d4eadb81aa33fc142c132ad"},"cell_type":"code","source":"news_train_data.shape","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"b7b48f8fdae220c48c3674d9b24d0111c4eb9636"},"cell_type":"code","source":"news_train_data.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"57ac5fcbf58c0a94ea15615a7e4b26168f6a188d"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The news data contains information at both the news article level and asset level (in other words, the table is intentionally not normalized).\n\n- time(datetime64[ns, UTC]) - UTC timestamp showing when the data was available on the feed (second precision)\n- sourceTimestamp(datetime64[ns, UTC]) - UTC timestamp of this news item when it was created\n- firstCreated(datetime64[ns, UTC]) - UTC timestamp for the first version of the item\n- sourceId(object) - an Id for each news item\n- headline(object) - the item's headline\n- urgency(int8) - differentiates story types (1: alert, 3: article)\n- takeSequence(int16) - the take sequence number of the news item, starting at 1.
