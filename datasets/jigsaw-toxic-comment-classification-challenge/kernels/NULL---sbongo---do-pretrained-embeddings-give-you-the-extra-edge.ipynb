Various implementations of word embeddings described below differs in the way as how they are constructed.\n", "\n", "**Word2Vec**\n", "\n", "The main idea behind it is that you train a model on the context on each word, so similar words will have similar numerical representations.\n", "\n", "Just like a normal feed-forward densely connected neural network(NN) where you have a set of independent variables and a target dependent variable that you are trying to predict, you first break your sentence into words(tokenize) and create a number of pairs of words, depending on the window size. So one of the combination could be a pair of words such as ('cat','purr'), where cat is the independent variable(X) and 'purr' is the target dependent variable(Y) we are aiming to predict.\n", "\n", "We feed the 'cat' into the NN through an embedding layer initialized with random weights, and pass it through the softmax layer with ultimate aim of predicting 'purr'. The optimization method such as SGD minimize the loss function \"(target word | context words)\" which seeks to minimize the loss of predicting the target words given the context words. If we do this with enough epochs, the weights in the embedding layer would eventually represent the vocabulary of word vectors, which is the \"coordinates\" of the words in this geometric vector space.\n", "\n", "![](https://i.imgur.com/R8VLFs2.png)\n", "\n", "The above example assumes the skip-gram model. For the Continuous bag of words(CBOW), we would basically be predicting a word given the context. \n", "\n", "**GLOVE**\n", "\n", "GLOVE works similarly as Word2Vec. While you can see above that Word2Vec is a \"predictive\" model that predicts context given word, GLOVE learns by constructing a co-occurrence matrix (words X context) that basically count how frequently a word appears in a context. Since it's going to be a gigantic matrix, we factorize this matrix to achieve a lower-dimension representation. There's a lot of details that goes in GLOVE but that's the rough idea.\n", "\n", "**FastText**\n", "\n", "FastText is quite different from the above 2 embeddings. While Word2Vec and GLOVE treats each word as the smallest unit to train on, FastText uses n-gram characters as the smallest unit. For example, the word vector ,\"apple\", could be broken down into separate word vectors units as \"ap\",\"app\",\"ple\". The biggest benefit of using FastText is that it generate better word embeddings for rare words, or even words not seen during training because the n-gram character vectors are shared with other words. This is something that Word2Vec and GLOVE cannot achieve.\n"], "metadata": {"_cell_guid": "f14a7be5-a88d-4f4d-95f8-fcfcafa39bc0", "_uuid": "c41191e2f86f00e8bdac86b3383b2d0bb43d247f"}}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "source": ["Let's start off with the usual importing pandas, etc"], "metadata": {"_cell_guid": "bbf5b274-f78a-49c9-b416-d510adb2b399", "_uuid": "96724c148074572ca78eb67573b74bea3ea48266"}}, {"execution_count": null, "cell_type": "code", "source": ["import sys, os, re, csv, codecs, numpy as np, pandas as pd\n", "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n", "%matplotlib inline\n", "from keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer\n", "from keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences\n", "from keras.layers import Dense, Input, LSTM, Embedding, Dropout, Activation\n", "from keras.layers import Bidirectional, GlobalMaxPool1D,Bidirectional\n", "from keras.models import Model\n", "from keras import initializers, regularizers, constraints, optimizers, layers\n", "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n", "%matplotlib inline\n", "import gensim.models.keyedvectors as word2vec\n", "import gc"], "outputs": [], "metadata": {"_cell_guid": "b6103d10-10b9-44dd-8c7c-ce71bb390833", "collapsed": true, "_uuid": "908cc6a5d46bae29f822e0dd353fd34947898706"}}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "source": ["Some preprocessing steps that we have taken in my earlier kernel."], "metadata": {"_cell_guid": "38caf564-a3b9-455e-8764-be6af9fc9eb9", "_uuid": "95f368df56588643270c781668fa0a51b183a7a5"}}, {"execution_count": null, "cell_type": "code", "source": ["train = pd.read_csv('../input/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/train.csv')\n", "test = pd.read_csv('../input/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/test.csv')\n", "embed_size=0"], "outputs": [], "metadata": {"_cell_guid": "05c286a1-2510-4c38-8922-6f4d8dcad863", "collapsed": true, "_uuid": "bead9ea1dfe1846027bfcd94a264a110b6f06e81"}}, {"execution_count": null, "cell_type": "code", "source": ["list_classes = [\"toxic\", \"severe_toxic\", \"obscene\", \"threat\", \"insult\", \"identity_hate\"]\n", "y = train[list_classes].values\n", "list_sentences_train = train[\"comment_text\"]\n", "list_sentences_test = test[\"comment_text\"]"], "outputs": [], "metadata": {"_cell_guid": "7e8ad169-36d2-4f13-8a6d-0b829451d6be", "collapsed": true, "_uuid": "a410746ad2dd36a2b9719382e04431eee5d34c68"}}, {"execution_count": null, "cell_type": "code", "source": ["max_features = 20000\n", "tokenizer = Tokenizer(num_words=max_features)\n", "tokenizer.fit_on_texts(list(list_sentences_train))\n", "list_tokenized_train = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(list_sentences_train)\n", "list_tokenized_test = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(list_sentences_test)"], "outputs": [], "metadata": {"_cell_guid": "3d2dad9a-7ce2-42a7-be74-c737618294aa", "collapsed": true, "_uuid": "a46ed61c7a46e6201d070531ab1794e998268c0e"}}, {"execution_count": null, "cell_type": "code", "source": ["maxlen = 200\n", "X_t = pad_sequences(list_tokenized_train, maxlen=maxlen)\n", "X_te = pad_sequences(list_tokenized_test, maxlen=maxlen)"], "outputs": [], "metadata": {"_cell_guid": "7d7a8d69-2ade-472b-8c6b-fdb6a916f24c", "collapsed": true, "_uuid": "b9e0c623fb56fa637df7a9f0659d36f9c639ac51"}}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "source": ["Since we are going to evaluate a few word embeddings, let's define a function so that we can run our experiment properly.
