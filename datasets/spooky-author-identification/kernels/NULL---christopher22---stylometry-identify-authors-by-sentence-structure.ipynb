While these type of messages may have significant advantages and allows us to persist in a globalized world, some question and problem arise we have to face. Undoubtfully, one crucial ability is the identification of an author through its texts; without direct contact, fakes are elsewhere hardly recognizable.\n", "The science of identifying authors by there writing is called Stylometry.

All these features are not needed for our current experiment but probably more useful when targetting lexical features.

It allows the efficient handling of huge multidimensional arrays with minimal copy costs and memory footprint. Depending on the style of usage, the performance benefits in comparison with Python lists are in general quite impressive. \n", "\n", "#### Neuronal network layout: *Keras*\n", "Keras is a wonderful simple wrapper for designing and training neural networks using the performance of the far more complex frameworks Theano and TensorFlow.
