This metric typically varies from 0 (random agreement between raters) to 1 (complete agreement between raters). In the event that there is less agreement between the raters than expected by chance, the metric may go below 0. The quadratic weighted kappa is calculated between the scores which are expected/known and the predicted scores. <br>\n\n\nResults have 5 possible ratings, 0,1,2,3,4.  The quadratic weighted kappa is calculated as follows. First, an N x N histogram matrix O is constructed, such that Oi,j corresponds to the number of adoption records that have a rating of i (actual) and received a predicted rating j. An N-by-N matrix of weights, w, is calculated based on the difference between actual and predicted rating scores.\n\nAn N-by-N histogram matrix of expected ratings, E, is calculated, assuming that there is no correlation between rating scores.  This is calculated as the outer product between the actual rating's histogram vector of ratings and the predicted rating's histogram vector of ratings, normalized such that E and O have the same sum.\n\nFrom these three matrices, the quadratic weighted kappa is calculated."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"7abf771b91a6be32ff212d4c3e6f9a2bcc6b3ac4"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Breaking down the formula into parts"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"971e777b1d954f0ad215dd5c8e0c511477bac6e1"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### 5 step breakdown for Weighted Kappa Metric"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"bf8b89f45237cda9d47a1f7ff764a82567e9f1f5"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"- First, create a multi class confusion matrix `O` between predicted and actual ratings. \n- Second, construct a weight matrix `w` which calculates the weight between the actual and predicted ratings. \n- Third, calculate `value_counts()` for each rating in preds and actuals. \n- Fourth, calculate `E`, which is the outer product of two value_count vectors \n- Fifth, normalise the `E` and `O` matrix\n- Caclulate, weighted kappa as per formula"},{"metadata":{"heading_collapsed":true,"_uuid":"a683efcad1c5a58668a4eab20f149b46442ad2e4"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Each Step Explained"},{"metadata":{"hidden":true,"_uuid":"7880113f8745ee347cb552991a0f4079b7d0de6f"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Step-1:** Under Step-1, we shall be calculating a `confusion_matrix` between the Predicted and Actual values. <a href=\"https://www.dataschool.io/simple-guide-to-confusion-matrix-terminology/\">Here</a> is a great resource to know more about `confusion_matrix`. <br>\n**Step-2:** Under Step-2, under step-2 each element is weighted.
