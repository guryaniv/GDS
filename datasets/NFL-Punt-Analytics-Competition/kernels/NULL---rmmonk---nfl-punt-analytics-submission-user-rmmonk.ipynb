It is the ultimate in blocks as the blocker is able to exhibit their blocking skill and strategic placement on the field. This style of block is comparable to a guerrilla warfare tactic, hiding in cover and surprising the tackler with immense force giving the tackler little to no time to react or brace. \n\nWhile there are a myriad of changes that can be made to the blindside block, I have proposed changes below, which can be combined or implemented alone. It is evident that something needs to be done, whether it be limiting the block or eliminating it completely as this style of block is visible in a large proportion of the injury videos provided. \n\nThese changes can be applied to the specific situation where the blocker is running towards their own endzone, in the opposite direction of the Punt Returner, or to blindside blocks as a whole. Note that this analysis only reviews blindside blocks as it related to the Punt Return:\n* - Any blindside blocks must have an acceleration zone of less than or equal to 5 yds and/or the blocker must not appear to be \"lining the tackler up for malicious purposes from an excessive distance .\"\n* - Blindside blocks can only be applied as body-to-body or in a push-style similar to a double handed stiff arm. No helmet contact allowed whatsoever on blindside blocks (combine with option for heavier consequences if rule is broken). \n* - Blindside blocks cannot be applied when there are 4+ players in a 3 yd radius of the block. \n* - Heavier consequences (e.g. ejection from game/player fines) for certain circumstances where the hit appears to be malicious in nature or intended to injure. \n\n## History:\n\nSource: http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d81c8823a/printable/leagues-official-player-safety-rules\nRule on BlindSide Blocks:\n3. \"Blindside\" Block. It is an illegal \"blindside\" block if the initial force of the contact by a blocker's helmet (including facemask), forearm, or shoulder is to the head or neck area of an opponent when the blocker is moving toward his own endline and approaches his opponent from behind or from the side.\n\nThis page was last updated in 2012. The reviewed data pertains to the 2016 and 2017 seasons. Of the 37 video links provided, 10 our of 37 (just over 25% or 1 / 4 concussions) are caused by a blocker moving toward their own endzone, opposite direction to their Punt Returner, and applying a block to an unsuspecting chase tackler. Some of the video review shows excessive force to the helmet either by the helmet or body of the blocker. This indicates that although this type of block is deemed illegal, it is still happening on a frequent enough basis to result in a significant number of concussions (approximately 10 out of 37). \n\n## ANALYSIS\n\nProcedure: \n\nMerge the play links with concussion data. \n\nWatch each injury link and take notes on each video attempting to identify the concussion causing incident. \n\nSearch for common occurrences or common incidents among the plays. \n\nRecord the time of the clip, the YD line and any other data that may be visible and pertinent (e.g. player number) that will allow subsequent reviewers to identify the same incident. \n \nBelow this you will see the code used to isolate these plays into the blindside_blocks listing, as well as the manual notes and video clip of each identified blindside block play.

When a tackler is in chase of the PR and their focus is locked onto that player they become  susceptible to blocks from the side or blocks where a player comes from out-of-view (e.g. from behind another player) to both surprise and block the tackler who has little to no time to react or brace for impact. In some cases an upwards explosion method is used to blow up the player and helmet-to-helmet or body-to-helmet impact is likely to occur. These types of blocks are normally followed by the audible sounds of very heavy impact.\n\nUpon manual video review of the 37 injury links, I noted 10 plays where this type of own endline blindside block was applied during a concussion injury event.\n\n**HOW DOES THE PROPOSED CHANGE REDUCE RISK OF CONCUSSIONS?**\n\nThe hope is that through heavier penalization/fines and a more specific guideline on the blindside block, players initiating a blindside block will be more likely to:\n- deter from helmet-to-helmet or body-to-helmet blindside hits, where the unsuspecting players helmet is contacted. \n- deter from lining players up and taking excessive acceleration distances when a minimal amount of force is required to knock unsuspecting players out of the play. \n- deter players from any potential intention to injure another player through malicious hits such as these. \n\nBased on manual video analysis above, 10/37 instances of concussion occurred when video showed some kind of blindside block being applied during the injury event.\n\nGuidelines to reduce the velocity and limit this type of block to body-to-body or push style block could reduce concussions by upwards of 25% on the Punt Play. \n\n**WHAT ARE THE NEW RISKS TO PLAYER SAFETY/GAME DYNAMICS FROM THE PROPOSED CHANGE?**\n\n- If the acceleration zone is minimized, the Punt Return may lose an element of excitement/danger/fast paced feel as players will be forced to limit their acceleration zone, limiting the force of the impact and as such limiting the \"hitting aesthetic\" of the Punt Return. To achieve similar style impacts, players will be forced to better time their hits or possibly do more to force the tackler into the way of other players, resulting in injuries to other extremities. \n\n- If the style of block is limited to a push style (like a two arm stiff arm), there may be more risk to other extremities or limbs (wrists, arms, legs) as extremities may be flailing and other players could fall on them. This risk is also present under the current situation but may be a higher degree (blockers may try to blindside players into other players with a push style blindside block). The individual blocking could be susceptible to more injuries to the arms if they are forced to use a push style block against a tackler heading the opposite direction. \n\n- If blindside blocks are limited to more open field areas (e.g. where there are less than 4 players in a short radius [say 3 yds], the punt return may lose an element of excitement as there will be less collateral blocks. It will be more difficult for the PR team to achieve larger returns since in some instances, collateral blocking can open up large lanes. The risk to player safety will be increased as there will be less instances of collateral damage, and less chance that an individual who is blindside blocked (and has little control over extremities) will be thrashed around or fallen on by other players. \n\n- If the blindside block is removed from the game completely, the game dynamics will shift in favour of the kicking team. It will be easier and more likely the PR will be tackled from behind or blindside tackled so the PR will have a much higher risk of injury. This is not ideal as the risk of injury for a Punt Returner is very high and removing this block would limit the protection available to the PR.\n\n**WHAT ARE THE RISKS TO THE INTEGRITY OF THE PUNT and THE GAME OF FOOTBALL?**\n\nThe reality is that a very minimal amount of force is required to throw an unsuspecting tackler off balance when being blindside blocked. Sometimes a small shove or push is all that is required to take the tackler out of the play. It is plausible that there are very few, if any, circumstances where the application of such explosive force to an unsuspecting victim is warranted. \n\nMore specific rules and guidelines and/or heavier penalties/fines will serve to uphold the integrity and sportsmanship of the Punt and the game of Football. A strong stance against this type of malicious hit will serve as a reminder of the NFL's continued support of the safety of the players and integrity of the game.\n\nElimination of the blindside block completely is not ideal as it opens ball carrier up to much larger risk of injury (less effective blocking of tacklers). It would serve the game much better if the allowable style of tackle being applied in a blindside scenario (push style, no direct body to helmet/helmet to helmet) and/or the velocity (yard distance with which a blocker can line-up a tackler) of the block vs. removing it from the game completely. \n\n**WHAT ARE SOME STEPS THAT COULD BE TAKEN TO IMPLEMENT (e.g. player training,  etc.)**\n\nThe below steps are optional, and at the discretion of the group implementing any rule changes. The purpose is to illustrate that this proposed change is actionable and steps can be taken to implement the change:\n- audit of special teams training during team practice to ensure new style of blindside block is being taught/practiced/applied.\n- heavier penalties and/or fines to players initiating illegal blindside blocks for what appear to be malicious hits (e.g. lining a player up 11 yds out and helmet to helmet blow when a push could be done may result in fine and expulsion/suspension). \n- prepare specific video examples of what is allowed and what is not allowed so there is no confusion prior to implementation. Each team should sign or report that they have educated their players on this matter and if want more extensive application, each player should sign a waiver indicating their acceptance of this block as malicious and that if intent to injure is assessed, the player will be open to pay fines/expulsion/suspension from games. \n\n**FURTHER DATA ANALYSIS:**\n- Use the data to isolate the blocker in each instance and assess if there was a lining up of the player and the distance at which the direction seems to alter to block the chaser. \n- Calculate the radius that these injuries are most likely to occur at (e.g. 7 yard lineups) and the min distance where injury is not likely. This should be the line-up distance allowed for acceleration into a block. \n\n**IS THE PROPOSED CHANGE ACTIONABLE BY THE NFL? (CONCLUSION)**\n\nBased on the above analysis, this proposed change is actionable by the NFL. There are various combinations of the proposed options that could be performed to find the optimal result to both reduce concussions as well as uphold the integrity of the Punt Return and game.\n\nThere will be much data to analyze, especially on the x,y coordinates of each of these plays (calculations of velocity, measurement of line-up distances etc.) to identify the optimal line-up range (e.g. 5-10 yds?) but the evidence is clear that some change is needed on the blindside block. \n\nThis style of block is clearly one of the highest injury causing blocks (almost 25% of concussions over 2016-2017 happened when an own endzone directed blindside block was applied). There needs to be some change in order to limit both the style of block (e.g. no helmet contact, push only etc.) and the velocity with which the block is applied (e.g. no line ups in excess of 5yds). \n\nI would not recommend removing this block completely as it will leave the Punt Returner, who is already very susceptible to injury on the Punt Return, to even more risk of serious injury by chasers who will freely tackle from the PR's blindside.

You are wrapped up and slowly falling to the ground, with a high likelihood of being downed when all of a sudden a tackling superhero from the opposing team decides to barrel into you, making sure you stay down with a vicious hit vs. a small tap by the hand which is all that is required to down a player. The player either strikes the PR directly or ends up causing damage to themselves or a teammate who has wrapped the PR and is falling down to the ground. \n\nThe proposed change(s) are as follows:\n- eliminate the diving at the lower body style of tackle from the PR if the PR is deemed to be going down. Accompany this with heavy penalization/fines to the player, especially when leading with the helmet. \n\n## History:\n\nSource: http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d81c8823a/printable/leagues-official-player-safety-rules\nRule on Tackling of PR:\n2.

During a kick or during a return, it is a foul if the initial force of the contact by a defender's helmet (including facemask), forearm, or shoulder is to the head or neck area of a kicker/punter.\n\nThis page was last updated in 2012. The reviewed data pertains to the 2016 and 2017 seasons. Of the 37 video links provided, 5 out of 37 (approximately 14%) are caused by a clearly excessive or unnecessary tackling by the defending team. \n\n## ANALYSIS\n\nProcedure: Merge the play links with concussion data. Watch each injury link and take notes on each video attempting to identify the concussion causing incident. Search for videos where excessive tackling (e.g. diving into a player already going down) is committed. \n\nThe code below will lay out the 4 plays related to this bucket, as well as links to the video and further information about the specific game (e.g. stadium, temperature etc.)\n\nSome observations during manual review:\n- In almost all instances, either the tackler injures another player or themselves by employing a lower body directed dive at the tackler.\n- In three of four cases, the tackle was applied when there was a high likelihood the PR would have been downed. \n- In one case, the concussion occured on a fair catch that was not caught, where the PR appears to be scrambling to make up the play. \n \nBelow this you will see the code used to isolate these plays into the excessive_tackle listing, as well as the manual notes and video clip of each identified play."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"b09f60349d429eeb289a1fc85444cebdb0ddc48c"},"cell_type":"code","source":"excessive_tackling = injury_and_game_data.iloc[[18, 22, 28, 29]]\n# excessive_tackling.head(10)  # Uncomment at begininng of line to view table","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"5d304152501fe66cd307d30824cb01cc8e6daa9a"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**GAME ID 296 PLAY ID 2667**\n\n(0:08s into clip on 22YD Line) - #36 is hit by own player after #36 has wrapped up the punt returner.

The change limits the type of tackle that can be thrown when the PR is already being downed or has a low likelihood of further progress on the punt return. \n\nIn the 4 videos reviewed, it was noted that injury was caused by excessive forms of tackling, most notably, a throwing of the body of the tackler into oncoming PR and play. It is common that the player behind the tackler, who can be wrapping the PR up is struck by friendly fire. This type of incident occurred in 4 out of 37 videos, or just over 10% of concussions. \n\n**HOW DOES THE PROPOSED CHANGE REDUCE RISK OF CONCUSSIONS?**\n\nThe hope is that through heavier penalization/fines players tackling the PR will be more likely to:\n- deter from helmet-to-helmet or body-to-helmet style diving tackles to ensure the PR is downed (when a simple touch could do the job)\n- deter from lining players up and throwing their body without control at the PR, reducing the risk of friendly fire and lowerbody injury to the PR\n\nBased on manual video analysis above, 4/37 instances of concussion occurred when video showed some kind of excessive or diving tackling, when it is likely it may not have been necessary. Guidelines to reduce the velocity and limit this type of tackle could help to eliminate concussion frequency by 10%. \n\n**WHAT ARE THE NEW RISKS TO PLAYER SAFETY/GAME DYNAMICS FROM THE PROPOSED CHANGE?**\n\n- The Punt Return is a fast paced play, with players running top speed in opposing directions. Reducing or limiting the style of tackle will make it more difficult for the kicking team to tackle and down the PR. Sometimes, downs are created by a player diving and sweeping the foot with one hand, tripping the PR up. This specific rule change applies only to the situation where a PR is already going down and a second, someitmes third tackler dives into the play to ensure the PR is downed. This is a largely unnecessary technique and it is difficult to warrant such a tackle. The risk of helmet to helmet or body to helmet injury increases as the PR being downed, or player wrapping them up is susceptile to being struck on the helmet. \n\n**WHAT ARE THE RISKS TO THE INTEGRITY OF THE PUNT and THE GAME OF FOOTBALL?**\n\n- Elimination of a low style of tackle would favour the Return team, making it far more difficult to tackle a PR (can't dive to cover the last bit of distance required). Limiting this style of tackle to not allow application when a player is already being downed or in some cases, already downed will serve to limit the injury directly to the PR, tackler or to other players near the play (most notably the tackler who has wrapped the PR up). \n\nAs with blindside blocks, this exvessive diving into an already downed or being downed PR is unnecessary and a down can be achieved with a far less impactful hit. \n\n**WHAT ARE SOME STEPS THAT COULD BE TAKEN TO IMPLEMENT (e.g. player training,  etc.)**\n\nThe below steps are optional, and at the discretion of the group implementing any rule changes. The purpose is to illustrate that this proposed change is actionable and steps can be taken to implement the change:\n- audit of special teams training during team practice to ensure new style of tackle is not being practiced and education to players not being delivered.\n- heavier penalties and/or fines to players initiating excessive tackle styles on already downed or players being downed, where likelihood of further progress of ball is unlikely. \n- players represent (e.g. signing documents in players agreements) that they will not apply this tackle, for risk of expulsion/fines.\n\n**FURTHER DATA ANALYSIS:**\n- Map specific plays where excessive tackling is visually noted. Check for more plays where PR is tackled by multiple individuals and assess if injury was present. \n- Note other instances where injury occurred as a result of over zealous tackling. \n\n**IS THE PROPOSED CHANGE ACTIONABLE BY THE NFL? (CONCLUSION)**\n\nBased on the above analysis, this proposed change is actionable by the NFL. Specific rules around excessive or forceful tacking on already downed/being downed PRs could help reduce concussions by up to 10%."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"f1f9e5703091013d74930a73dfd3e6c5a4a86b8b","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"## REFERENCES:\n\"\"\"\n1.
