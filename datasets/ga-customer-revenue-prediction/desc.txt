The 80/20 rule has proven true for many businesses–only a small percentage of
customers produce most of the revenue. As such, marketing teams are challenged
to make appropriate investments in promotional strategies. RStudio, the
developer of free and open tools for R and enterprise-ready products for teams
to scale and share work, has partnered with Google Cloud and Kaggle to
demonstrate the business impact that thorough data analysis can have. In this
competition, you’re challenged to analyze a Google Merchandise Store (also
known as GStore, where Google swag is sold) customer dataset to predict
revenue per customer. Hopefully, the outcome will be more actionable
operational changes and a better use of marketing budgets for those companies
who choose to use data analysis on top of GA data.
