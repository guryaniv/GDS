Decided to familiarize myself with some of the images to see if any visual patterns emerge. After seeing about 25 or so, it's clear that there are some very significant differences in the types of images being presented. So far, i'm seeing at least 3 classes of photos;  My initial thought is that I will need to review all the images to see just how many classes I can identify, then design pre-processing techniques for each of the classes. I'm thinking I can use openCV to convert to greyscale, and then test foreground/background  thresholds to get an appropriate count and or using blobdetection (will come back to this).
