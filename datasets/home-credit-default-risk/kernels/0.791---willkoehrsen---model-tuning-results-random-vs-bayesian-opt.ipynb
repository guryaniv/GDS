The results in this notebook are from 500 iterations of random search and 400 iterations of Bayesian Optimization (these took about 5 days to run each). We will thoroughly explore the results both visually and statistically, and then implement the best hyperparameter values on a full set of features. After all the hard work in the random search and Bayesian optimization notebooks, now we get to have some fun! \n\n# Roadmap\n\nOur plan of action is as follows:\n\n1. High Level Overview\n    * Which method did best? \n2. Examine distribution of scores\n    * Are there trends over the course of the search?\n3. Explore hyperparameter values\n    * Look at values over the course of the search\n    * Identify correlations between hyperparameters and the score\n4. Perform \"meta\" machine learning using these results\n    * Fit a linear regression to results and look at coefficients\n5. Train a model on the full set of features using the best performing values\n    * Try best results from both random search and bayesian optimization\n6.  Lay out next steps\n    * How can we use these results for this _and other_ problems? \n    * Are there better methods for hyperparameter optimization\n    \nAt each step, we will use plenty of figures and statistics to explore the data. This will be a fun notebook (even though it may not land you at the top of the leaderboard)! \n\n## Recap \n\nIn the respective notebooks, we examined we performed 1000 iterations of random search and Bayesian optimization on a reduced sample of the dataset (10000 rows). We compared the cross-validation ROC AUC on the training data, the score on a \"testing set\" (6000 observations) and the score on the real test set when submitted to the competition leaderboard. Results are below:\n\n| Method                               | Cross Validation Score | Test Score (on 6000 Rows) | Submission to Leaderboard | Iterations to best score |\n|--------------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Random Search                        | 0.73110                | 0.73274                   | 0.782                     | 996                      |\n| Bayesian Hyperparameter Optimization | 0.73448                | 0.73069                   | 0.792                     | 596                      "},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"5097567a14b59d0ad66fba8ae296ec745adacf9c"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"__Take these with some skepticism because they were performed on a very small subset of the data!__ \n\nFor more rigorous results, we will turn to the evaluation metrics from running __500 iterations (with random search)__ and __400+ iterations (with Bayesian Optimization)__ on a full training dataset with about 700 features (the features are from [this notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/jsaguiar/updated-0-792-lb-lightgbm-with-simple-features) by [Aguiar](https://www.kaggle.com/jsaguiar)).

That single number does not tell the whole story though as the Bayesian method average ROC AUC was much higher than that of random search. We expect this to be the case because Bayesian optimization should focus on higher scoring values based on the surrogate model of the objective function it constructs. Morevoer, this tells us Bayesian optimization is a valuable technique, but random search can still happen upon better values in fewer search iterations if we are lucky. \n\n* Random search slightly outperformed Bayesian optimization in terms of cv ROC AUC \n* Bayesian optimization average scores were much higher than random search indicating it spends more time evaluating \"better\" hyperparameters\n* Bayesian scored 0.791 when submitted and random search scored 0.790 indicating that with enough iterations, the methods deliver similar results\n* Boosting type \"gdbt\" did much better than \"goss\" with \"dart\" nearly as good\n* A lower learning rate resulted in higher model scores: lower than 0.02 looks to be optimal\n* `reg_alpha` and `reg_lambda` should complement one another: if one is high (above 0.5), than the other should be lower (below 0.5)\n* Some subsampling appears to increase the model scores\n* The other hyperparameters either did not have a significant effect, or their effects are intertwined and hence could not be disentangled in this study\n\nFeel free to build upon these results! I'm curious if the best hyperparameters for this dataset will translate to other datasets, either for this problem, or for vastly different data science problems. The best way to find out is to try them! \n\nIf you're looking for more work on this problem, I have a series of notebooks documenting my work:\n\n__Additional Notebooks__ \n\n* [A Gentle Introduction](https://www.kaggle.com/willkoehrsen/start-here-a-gentle-introduction)\n* [Manual Feature Engineering Part One](https://www.kaggle.com/willkoehrsen/introduction-to-manual-feature-engineering)\n* [Manual Feature Engineering Part Two](https://www.kaggle.com/willkoehrsen/introduction-to-manual-feature-engineering-p2)\n* [Introduction to Automated Feature Engineering](https://www.kaggle.com/willkoehrsen/automated-feature-engineering-basics)\n* [Advanced Automated Feature Engineering](https://www.kaggle.com/willkoehrsen/tuning-automated-feature-engineering-exploratory)\n* [Feature Selection](https://www.kaggle.com/willkoehrsen/introduction-to-feature-selection)\n* [Intro to Model Tuning: Grid and Random Search](https://www.kaggle.com/willkoehrsen/intro-to-model-tuning-grid-and-random-search)\n* [Automated Model Tuning](https://www.kaggle.com/willkoehrsen/automated-model-tuning)\n\nThanks for reading and feel free to share any constructive criticism or feedback. \n\nBest,\n\nWill"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"29fe0993321bf8ae436d461ce25a25db8bd9fe6d"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
