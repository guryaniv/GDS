More details about why this is the case can be found in a great [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/interpretable-machine-learning-with-xgboost-9ec80d148d27) by one of SHAP authors.\nA proposed remedy is using [**SHAP**](https://github.com/slundberg/shap), which provides a unified approach for intepreting output of machine learning methods.\nDetailed information about how it works can be found in the above linked article and their [NIPS paper](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7062-a-unified-approach-to-interpreting-model-predictions).\n\nBeing able to explain model output is especially important in cases, when it is going to be deployed as a service or application. Knowing whether it learns useful features is crucial. \nOn tabular data, where domain knowledge is the key, one can check feature importance and deduce, if most important features according to the model can influence the predicted values in reality. Based on this, model reliability can be estimated. To give a basic example, when trying to predict price of a house, factors such as it's area or location should directly influence the price. If instead of those, a model will consider totally random feature important (like, let's say, mean temperature of a random month during last year), it is easy to arrive at a conclusion that something is definitely wrong.\n\nIn case of competitions, being able to interpret model output gives a direction of feature engineering, which is worth following.\nHere, we do not care about importance making sense this much but rather creating new features further improving model performance.\nWhen we know which of the features are considered important, there is a chance that features derived from those will provide model with additional information, enabling a boost in score.\nAnother thing to consider is the differences between distribution of certain features in train and test data. If train set feature distribution is very different from its test set distribution and it is considered very important by a model, there may be a risk that model performance on the test set may be not very reliable.\n\nNow,  let's check what kind of information SHAP will give us in case of the Two Sigma competition!\nBecause the aim of the kernel is to showcase model importance output, basis for feature engineering is taken from a kernel, which scores well on LB. \n\n#### Data processing & feature engineering taken from: https://www.kaggle.com/qqgeogor/eda-script-67.

Fast exact computation of pairwise interactions are implemented in the latest version of XGBoost with the pred_interactions flag. With this flag XGBoost returns a matrix for every prediction, where the main effects are on the diagonal and the interaction effects are off-diagonal. The main effects are similar to the SHAP values you would get for a linear model, and the interaction effects captures all the higher-order interactions are divide them up among the pairwise interaction terms. Note that the sum of the entire interaction matrix is the difference between the model's current output and expected output, and so the interaction effects on the off-diagonal are split in half (since there are two of each). When plotting interaction effects the SHAP package automatically multiplies the off-diagonal values by two to get the full interaction effect.\"\n\n\nFor this one, we will further limit the dataset size to speed up the computation."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"ee125858479e6f24d5a7a0058a501d7115dfb4f1"},"cell_type":"code","source":"X_interaction = X_importance.iloc[:500,:]\n\nshap_interaction_values = shap.TreeExplainer(lgb_model).shap_interaction_values(X_interaction)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"30566c3e9ca4450b4192e62ef6942183fef581f9"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Interaction - a summary:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"979dd519d6aba93be56f5ff283208bf26a341639"},"cell_type":"code","source":"shap.summary_plot(shap_interaction_values, X_interaction)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"823581e8bc5f406bb5caa878a20f01339812d944"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Interaction - dependence plots:\n\nUsing dependence plots with interaction values enables assessment of main and interaction effects between features.\nFirst, let's take a look at raw `returnsClosePrevRaw10_lag_3_mean` dependence plot again and then compare it to interaction plots capturing both main and interaction effects."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"07ca25c22d17714b1d22aa4ae4b6a262f5e65a2e"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Raw dependence plot:\n\nshap.dependence_plot(\n    \"returnsClosePrevRaw10_lag_3_mean\",\n    shap_values, X_importance)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"edbef3241532b4ee57009db8e5af37c3a129078e"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Interaction values dependence plot capturing main effects:\n\nshap.dependence_plot(\n    (\"returnsClosePrevRaw10_lag_3_mean\", \"returnsClosePrevRaw10_lag_3_mean\"),\n    shap_interaction_values, X_interaction)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"ff43759fe3311d61a26e84e69144f399130e5fd8"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Vertical disperion for interaction plot, which captures main effects, is lower than in the original plot, which was to be expected."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"6bc135b482cfda7a156ac81b11deafd7ba5b5d39"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Interaction values dependence plot capturing interaction effects:\n\nshap.dependence_plot(\n    (\"returnsClosePrevRaw10_lag_3_mean\", \"returnsOpenPrevMktres10\"),\n    shap_interaction_values, X_interaction)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"c085f04ebd86e3345d029a84ef5707b91563ab13"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"When interaction between `returnsClosePrevRaw10_lag_3_mean` and `returnsOpenPrevMktres10` is checked, one interesting result is that for returnsClosePrevRaw10_lag_3_mean equal to 0, higher values of returnsOpenPrevMktres10 seem to push the model output lower, whereas higher values of returnsOpenPrevMktres10 for values of returnsClosePrevRaw10_lag_3_mean above 0.6 push the model output higher."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"63d673c4411f826c42f4316aa1412cf9a3a848d4"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Get important features according to SHAP:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"scrolled":true,"_uuid":"0b0fd969ba7ca9faaef3a37c38e53295fe5288b9"},"cell_type":"code","source":"shap_sum = np.abs(shap_values).mean(axis=0)\nimportance_df = pd.DataFrame([X_importance.columns.tolist(), shap_sum.tolist()]).T\nimportance_df.columns = ['column_name', 'shap_importance']\nimportance_df = importance_df.sort_values('shap_importance', ascending=False)\nimportance_df","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"f9e687d6cc9d3f5d9e338c0a5847f2c0e99c8984"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
