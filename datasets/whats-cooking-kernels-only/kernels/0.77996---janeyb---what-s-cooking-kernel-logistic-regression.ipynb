For example, salt may be used in every single cuisine and therefore is not very meaningful for us to use. The Tfidf (Term Frequency – Inverse Document Frequency ) penalises 'salt' using the inverse document frequency term.\n\nThere will also be several conditions within the vectorization steps: \n1) Lemmatizing the words so that similar words can be recognised e.g. olives and olive\n2) Removing stopwords such as 'the' and 'and' which will likely not be linked to any cuisine type and will contribute to noise\n3) Tokenizing on words only with a token pattern, ignoring any numbers which again will likely just be noise. \n4) Ensuring all words are lowercase as capslock can interfere with matching. \n5) For Tfidf, we also can specify max_df which gives the threshold for words that could be left out. For example, the threshold could be 1 (word features in all docs/sentences/groups) and so any word that has 1 for a value and features in every group will not be included. I have set the threshold to 0.6 for now but we can play with this. \n6) Using bi-grams rather than uni-grams\n\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"scrolled":true,"_uuid":"aee975189c8d9a3e2e030bc961c690811fbee80c"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Creating a pipeline\n\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\n\n#Vectorize imports\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\n\nfrom nltk import word_tokenize          \nfrom nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer \nclass LemmaTokenizer(object):\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.wnl = WordNetLemmatizer()\n    def __call__(self, doc):\n        return [self.wnl.lemmatize(t) for t in word_tokenize(doc)]\npattern = r\"[A-Za-z]\" \nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import MaxAbsScaler\n\n# Set up a vectorizer which can be tested and words substituted into it.\n\nvec = CountVectorizer(tokenizer=LemmaTokenizer(), stop_words = 'english', lowercase = True, token_pattern = pattern, ngram_range = (1,2))\n#vec = TfidfVectorizer(tokenizer=LemmaTokenizer(), stop_words = 'english', lowercase = True, token_pattern = pattern, max_df = 0.1, ngram_range = (1,2))\n\n#Classifier imports\n#from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB - 0.74\n#from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier - 0.40\n#from sklearn.svm import SVC\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\nfrom sklearn.learning_curve import validation_curve\n\nC_param_range = [0.5,0.8,1,2,3]\naccuracy_list = []\n#Set up a classifier\nfor i in C_param_range:  \n    classifier = LogisticRegression(penalty = 'l2', C = i,random_state = 0)\n    # Create and fit the pipeline\n    pl = Pipeline([\n        ('vec',vec), \n        ('scale', MaxAbsScaler()),\n        ('classifier', classifier)])\n    pl.fit(X_train, y_train)\n    accuracy = pl.score(X_test, y_test)\n    print (accuracy)\n    accuracy_list.append(accuracy)\n\nzipped = list(zip(C_param_range,accuracy_list))\nprint (zipped)\n#print ('The score is: %.5f '% accuracy)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"0cf3e98bc091fc8443aae2ed2a54e688f5945e4c"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Best score so far is: 0.78856\n# What is the maximum accuracy we have got so far and which parameter value does it correspond to?\nfrom operator import itemgetter\nfrom heapq import nlargest\nimport itertools\n\nresult = max(zipped,key=lambda x:x[1])\nprint (result[0])\n\nclassifier = LogisticRegression(penalty = 'l2', C = result[0],random_state = 0)\n\n#Create and fit the pipeline\npl = Pipeline([\n    ('vec',vec), \n    ('scale', MaxAbsScaler()),\n    ('classifier', classifier)])\npl.fit(X_train, y_train)\ny_predicted = pl.predict(X_test)\naccuracy = pl.score(X_test, y_test)\nprint ('The score is: %.5f '% accuracy)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"12939200a995381d6ebd34a637d15793073e1bfb"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Using a confusion matrix to identify areas of error - where could we focus a model fix?\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\n\ncm = pd.DataFrame(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_predicted, labels=train_df['cuisine'].unique()), index=train_df['cuisine'].unique(), columns=train_df['cuisine'].unique())\n\ntotals = y_test.value_counts()\ntotals_from_training = y_train.value_counts()\njoined = pd.concat([cm, totals], axis = 'columns', sort = False)\njoined['totals_from_test'] = joined.iloc[:,-1]\njoined['totals_from_training'] = totals_from_training\njoined['%_correct'] = [round((joined.loc[i,i])/(joined.loc[i,'totals_from_test']),2) for i in joined.columns[:-3]]\njoined","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"eac82bc988f66a28384ac05d4188c2a1082f5234"},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Are the less common cuisines predicted correctly less of the time?
