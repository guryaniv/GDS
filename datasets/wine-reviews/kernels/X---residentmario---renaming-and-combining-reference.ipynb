In that case, we may use `pandas` renaming utility functions to change the names of the offending entries to something better.\n\nThe first function we'll introduce here is `rename`, which lets you rename index names and/or column names. For example, to change the `points` column in our dataset to `score`, we would do:"},{"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"trusted":false,"_uuid":"de5961708735c97309d88f8c969c2a307d0c0bfa"},"cell_type":"code","source":"reviews.rename(columns={'points': 'score'})","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"303ece9aba0eb9c918c1b0201aaa1e1795736839"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"`rename` lets you rename index _or_ column values by specifying a `index` or `column` keyword parameter, respectively.

In order of increasing complexity, these are `concat`, `join`, and `merge`. Most of what `merge` can do can also be done more simply with `join`, so I will omit it and focus on the first two functions here.\n\nThe simplest combining method is `concat`. This function works just like the `list.concat` method in core Python: given a list of elements, it will smush those elements together along an axis.\n\nThis is useful when we have data in different `DataFrame` or `Series` objects but having the same fields (columns). One example: the [YouTube Videos dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new), which splits the data up based on country of origin (e.g. Canada and the UK, in this example). If we want to study multiple countries simultaneously, we can use `concat` to smush them together:"},{"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"trusted":false,"_uuid":"f8462891fca7ddf33800dd0761b0c91ed287c693"},"cell_type":"code","source":"canadian_youtube = pd.read_csv(\"../input/youtube-new/CAvideos.csv\")\nbritish_youtube = pd.read_csv(\"../input/youtube-new/GBvideos.csv\")\n\npd.concat([canadian_youtube, british_youtube])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8b6f82f80d59693b5a49e38cf46f98d59cb3c707"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The middlemost combiner in terms of complexity is `pd.DataFrame.join`. `join` lets you combine different `DataFrame` objects which have an index in common.
