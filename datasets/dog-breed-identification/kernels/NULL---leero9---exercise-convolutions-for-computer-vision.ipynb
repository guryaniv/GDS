We'll apply it to each part of an image to create a new tensor showing where there are vertical lines.\n\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/op9Maqr.png)\n\nFollow these following 4 steps:\n1. **Fork this notebook**\n2. **Run this full notebook and scroll down to see the output**  You will see the original image, as well as an example of the image we get from applying our horizontal line detector to the image.\n3. **Fill in the code cell for `vertical_line_conv`.**  You will have to think about what numbers in the list will create a vertical line detector.  Run this cell.\n4. **Add `vertical_line_conv` to `conv_list`.  Run that cell.**  You will see the output of your vertical line filter underneath the horizontal line filter.  You will also see a printed hint indicating if you got this right.  \n\nOnce that's done, you are ready to learn about deep convolutional models, the key to modern computer vision breakthroughs.\n\n---\n\n# Import Utility Functions\nWe'll use some small utilty functions to load raw image data, visualize the results and give hints on your answert, etc.  Don't worry about these, but execute the next cell to load the utility functions.\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"1c812b255b9e577cd5f5118823ad3c7725bc8872","collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"ee82df62-e608-4bc5-8262-f6ad4961054b","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"from learntools.deep_learning.exercise_1 import load_my_image, apply_conv_to_image, show, print_hints","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"aef8e139775e21a4e01ad07547aa83a6f3a72919","_cell_guid":"805ef092-0efe-4a85-a0df-5e5d17404469"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Example Convolution: Horizontal Line Detector\nHere is the convolution you saw in the video.
