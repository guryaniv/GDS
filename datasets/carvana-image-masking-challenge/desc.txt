As with any big purchase, full information and transparency are key. While
most everyone describes buying a used car as frustrating, it’s just as
annoying to sell one, especially online. Shoppers want to know everything
about the car but they must rely on often blurry pictures and little
information, keeping used car sales a largely inefficient, local industry.
Carvana, a successful online used car startup, has seen opportunity to build
long term trust with consumers and streamline the online buying process. An
interesting part of their innovation is a custom rotating photo studio that
automatically captures and processes 16 standard images of each vehicle in
their inventory. While Carvana takes high quality photos, bright reflections
and cars with similar colors as the background cause automation errors, which
requires a skilled photo editor to change. In this competition, you’re
challenged to develop an algorithm that automatically removes the photo studio
background. This will allow Carvana to superimpose cars on a variety of
backgrounds. You’ll be analyzing a dataset of photos, covering different
vehicles with a wide variety of year, make, and model combinations.
