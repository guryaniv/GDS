Autoencoders aren't new to machine learning, but they are not as prolific as some of the newer techniques in deep learning. An autoencoder's goal is to compress an input and then reconstruct the original input from the compressed data.\n![deep_autoencoder.png](https://deeplearning4j.org/img/deep_autoencoder.png)\n\nIt is an unsupervised algorithm since the target variable is the input. There are many use cases and interesting applications of autoencoders which can be seen [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/autoencoders-bits-and-bytes-of-deep-learning-eaba376f23ad).\n\n\nIn the case of detecting fraud, the approach is to build a model that will learn the characteristics of a normal transaction by training the model on non-fraudulent data points only. The idea is to get the model as accurate as possible at recreating normal transaction from the filtered data set. Once you have a model that can recreate normal transactions with a given amount of error, you then use the model to predict a set of data that has both normal and fraudulent transaction. If everything goes well, you will have a model that given a normal transaction will predict the original inputs with a small margin of error and a much larger error for transactions that are fraudulent."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"83ea2a54-6bc0-48b1-9fb9-66d0dcb8ef7f","_uuid":"a85b1c0a377cd3b6ab90dda3554f41b6446d3274","collapsed":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv('../input/creditcard.csv')","execution_count":45,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"817885de-d425-4410-9b66-0d84bf3f4726","_uuid":"d4cfc47ab4597029dcdcd000d5c9c9e1bfdc028f"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Since the *time* column comes in as seconds from the start of the 2 day period.

The dashed red line represents a random guess of a 50/50 chance of predicting the correct outcome. Ideally the ROC line would fit perfectly in the upper left hand corner which would represent a perfect model. While the ROC AUC is generally a good thing to use to check model performance, it only looks at 2 of the possible 4 outcomes of binary classification. False Negatives and True negatives are not directly observed in this plot. To get the rest of the story it is necessary to look at the confusion matrix. \n\nWhen performing binary classification there are 4 types of outcomes:\n\n![confusion_matrix_1.png](https://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/user_guide/evaluate/confusion_matrix_files/confusion_matrix_1.png)\n\nIn the case of this dataset:\n* ***True Positive:*** The number of normal transactions did we correctly predict as normal\n* ***False Negatives:*** The number of normal transactions that the model incorrectly classifies as fraud\n* ***False Positives:*** The number of fraudulent transactions the model incorrectly classifies as normal\n* ***True Negatives:*** The number of fraudlent transactions the model accurately classifies as fraud\n\nSince our predictions are based on the error between the original and predicted values of the input, it is necessary to find a cut-off point in the error where anything above the threshold is considered fraud, and anything below is considered to be a normal transaction. To start I decided to set the threshold as the sum of the mean and standard deviation of the error of the normal transactions."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"29e00b5b-435a-455a-9881-77f73e81c8ee","_uuid":"3b6fd60fa1b4d9209853cec5853c2154203ecc21","collapsed":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"temp_df = error_df[error_df['true'] == 0]\nthreshold = temp_df['error'].mean() + temp_df['error'].std()\nprint(f'Threshold: {threshold:.3f}')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"dbcb7fce-ebee-46ab-8a18-1d7a054f20e7","_uuid":"3759f05c62db00f80ff771c40ab15f498e3f2ef0","collapsed":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"y_pred = [1 if e > threshold else 0 for e in error_df.error.values]\nprint(classification_report(error_df.true.values,y_pred))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"9acbc23c-0f97-490d-92b4-a6ce269689d9","_uuid":"2f19cf111af255816b9ea4a4fe45ed61ab60f5c1"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Above is the classification report, but I found these metrics to be a bit deceiving and hard to conceptualize.

In this notebook I did not attempt to do any feature engineering or general dimensional reduction (although the autoencoder does) to try to improve the model.\n\nIn general the model performs well, but there is still a small number of fraudulent transactions that can't be cleanly separated from normal transactions. The model provides a decision space to do tradeoff analysis and determine the best threshold given how much a fraudulent transaction costs the business vs how much it costs to incorrectly label normal transactions (which is difficult to quantify).\n\nNext, I would like to look into ensembling this with other models as well as taking the weights of the pre-trained autoencoder and using additonal layers to perform the final binary classification.\n\nThanks for reading."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.4","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
