We can look at the structure of the missing values - which features are affected, which records are affected, and differences between train and test. We can also use the missing data as a feature by counting it or transforming it. In this kernel I explore some patterns and suggest one way to improve your model with the findings.\n\n### Patterns\nFirst let's look at the overall pattern of missing data. The [missingno](https://github.com/ResidentMario/missingno) package by [Aleksey Bilogur](https://www.kaggle.com/residentmario) is the perfect tool here. Looking at a sample of data for all columns we see a group of columns where the missing values appear correlated.\n\n"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport missingno as msno\n\ntrain = pd.read_csv('../input/application_train.csv')\nmsno.matrix(train.sample(500), inline=True, sparkline=True, figsize=(20,10), sort=None)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"b4585fbf7adfebe232f388daf9b25c03b2351877","collapsed":true},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's also look at the Test set.

Viewed one way, borrowers with incomplete applications are ~30% more likely to default. You may want to include this information in your model somehow. So far I found it helpful to add a binary feature called 'no_housing_info'. The application gets a 1 if the # of NAs related to housing is > 45, otherwise 0. You could also create three classes to account for the applications with some housing data (which may denote apartment dwellers). \n\nYou can also look at the dendrogram and find ways to compare columns. You might find useful flags if an application has one feature missing but another filled in. There are many possibilities!\n\n\n### Statistical Significance\nSomeone suggested I look at statistical significance of the difference in default rates mentioned above. Good advice! I'll use a [G-test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-test) which is similar to Pearson's chi-squared test. Either one should work in this case, but I generally prefer the G-test."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"182bb463085a97f5d828b9cbaa58f96ddf8e5fc0"},"cell_type":"code","source":"from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency\n\nprops = pd.crosstab(train.incomplete, train.TARGET)\nc = chi2_contingency(props, lambda_=\"log-likelihood\")\nprint(props, \"\\n p-value= \", c[1])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"c97488cda8a681483f59b4456ab6835d75f43e6f"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\"If p is low, the null must go.\" So we can reject the null hypothesis with only a small probability of [Type 1 error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors). In other words, the difference in default ratios between the two groups is not due to random chance. The question now is can we capture the difference in our model?\n\nGood luck!"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
