It is a region of the world that is still relatively less developed than other regions. But it is also considered the next frontier in investments (emerging markets). The more economically developed countries are shifting that economies from manufacturing economies to service providing economies. In this project a preliminary exploration of the progress of SADC countries in light of the continuously connecting and automating world is attempted. The general state of the economies and their trade capabilities are explored in an attempt to see where automation would leave these economies.__\n\nComments and suggestion are welcome...in fact encouraged.
