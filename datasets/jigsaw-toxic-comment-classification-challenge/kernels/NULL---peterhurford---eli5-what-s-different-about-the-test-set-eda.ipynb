Well rather than predicting whether an individual comment was \"toxic\" or not, we instead tried to predict whether an individual comment was from the train set or not. This is called **adversarial validation**. It looks like we succeeded with a AUC of 0.7. (...Not a high AUC by the standards of this competition, but a high AUC by the standards of models typically.)\n\nBut now what is driving these predictions? [ElL5](http://eli5.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a library that can help us with that - it lets you look at the model weights and TFIDF vectorizer under the hood and see what's going on. (Maybe more like ELI25 than ELI5, but still much easier to understand.)
