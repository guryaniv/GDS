We can make hundreds of features, and some will turn out to be corelated with the target simply because of random noise in the data. Then, when our model trains, it may overfit to these variables because it thinks they have a relationship with the target in the training set, but this does not necessarily generalize to the test set. There are many considerations that we have to take into account when making features!

The model is definitely not optimized to our data, but we still had a noticeable improvement over the original dataset when using the calculated features. Let's officially summarize the performances:\n\n| __Experiment__ | __Train AUC__ | __Validation AUC__ | __Test AUC__  |\n|------------|-------|------------|-------|\n| __Control__    | 0.815 | 0.760      | 0.745 |\n| __Test One__   | 0.837 | 0.767      | 0.759 |\n| __Test Two__   | 0.826 | 0.765      | 0.753 |\n\n\n(Note that these scores may change from run to run of the notebook. I have not observed that the general ordering changes however.)\n\nAll of our hard work translates to a small improvement of 0.014 ROC AUC over the original testing data. Removing the highly collinear variables slightly decreases performance so we will want to consider a different method for feature selection. Moreover, we can say that some of the features we built are among the most important as judged by the model. \n\nIn a competition such as this, even an improvement of this size is enough to move us up 100s of spots on the leaderboard. By making numerous small improvements such as in this notebook, we can gradually achieve better and better performance. I encourage others to use the results here to make their own improvements, and I will continue to document the steps I take to help others. \n\n## Next Steps\n\nGoing forward, we can now use the functions we developed in this notebook on the other datasets. There are still 4 other data files to use in our model! In the next notebook, we will incorporate the information from these other data files (which contain information on previous loans at Home Credit) into our training data. Then we can build the same model and run more experiments to determine the effect of our feature engineering. There is plenty more work to be done in this competition, and plenty more gains in performance to be had! I'll see you in the next notebook."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"16ae453a2a7683eebfa97a14c9bbb8adba7a9a10"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
