Submissions are evaluated on the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC)
between the predicted and the observed response. The MCC is given by: MCC=
(TP∗TN)−(FP∗FN) √ (TP+FP)(TP+FN)(TN+FP)(TN+FN) , where TP is the number of
true positives, TN the number of true negatives, FP the number of false
positives, and FN the number of false negatives. Submission File For each
signal in the test set, you must predict a binary prediction for the target
variable. The file should contain a header and have the following format:
signal_id,target 0,0 1,1 2,0 etc.
