In this Kernel, I will step by step process messy data and build a ML model  to predict the survival of each passenger aboard the Titanic. This guide is meant for people starting with data visualization, analysis and Machine Learning. If that sounds like you, then you're in the right place! It is not as difficult as you think to understand.\n\n*Please upvote and share if this helps you!! Also, feel free to fork this kernel to play around with the code and test it for yourself. If you plan to use any part of this code, please reference this kernel!* I will be glad to answer any questions you may have in the comments. Thank You! \n\n*Make sure to follow me for Future Kernels even better than this one!*"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"e612770d6037cf3154b20ab7f78be0b0c7b48617"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## **Classification vs. Regression**\nAs you know, predicting Titanic survivors is a supervised classification Machine Learning problem, where you classify a passenger as either survived, or not survived. Whereas in regression, you predict a continuous value like house price.

These people are likely extremely overfitting their models, or cheating since the test set survivors are available publicly online.
