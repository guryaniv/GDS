Submissions are evaluated using a weighted multi-class logarithmic loss. The
overall effect is such that each class is roughly equally important for the
final score. Each object has been labeled with one type. For each object, you
must submit a set of predicted probabilities (one for every category). The
formula is then Log Loss=−( ∑ M i=1 wi⋅∑ Ni j=1 yij Ni ⋅lnpij ∑ M i=1 wi )
where N is the number of objects in the class set, M is the number of classes,
ln is the natural logarithm, yij is 1 if observation (i) belongs to class (j)
and 0 otherwise, pij is the predicted probability that observation i belongs
to class j . The submitted probabilities for a given object are not required
to sum to one because they are rescaled prior to being scored (each row is
divided by the row sum). In order to avoid the extremes of the log function,
predicted probabilities are replaced with max(min(p,1−10−15),10−15) .
Submission File For each object ID in the test set, you must predict a
probability for each of the different possible classes. The file should
contain a header and have the following format:
object_id,class_6,class_15,class_16,class_42,class_52,class_53,class_62,class_64,class_65,class_67,class_88,class_90,class_92,class_95,class_99
13,0,0.1,0,0.1,0,0.3,0,0,0,0,0,0.5,0,0,0 14,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
17,0.75,0.23,0,0,0.01,0,0,0,0,0.01,0,0,0,0,0 etc.
