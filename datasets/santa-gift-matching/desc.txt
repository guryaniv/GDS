‘Tis the night before Christmas year: two thousand seventeen. Santa’s grown
grouchy, borderline mean. What used to be simple for Old St. Nick, is now too
puzzling, it’s making him sick! See, Santa always knew, deep down in his gut,
what toy each kid wanted–no ifs, ands, or buts. But fierce population growth,
more twins, and toy innovation, has left too complex a problem, in dire need
of optimization. “Don’t worry, Mr. Santa”, said an Elf named McMaggle, “I have
a solution! Have you heard of Kaggle?” As she explained Kaggle in-depth,
Santa’s doubt began turning, he became a believer in the magic of...machine
learning. So, Santa’s team needs YOU more than ever this year, to solve this
painful problem and save Christmas cheer. The Challenge In this playground
competition, you’re challenged to build a toy matching algorithm that
maximizes happiness by pairing kids with toys they want. In the dataset, each
kid has 10 preferences for their gift (from 1000) and Santa has 1000 preferred
kids for every gift available. What makes this extra difficult is that 0.4% of
the kids are twins, and by their parents’ request, require the same gift.
