For example, when detecting cancer we can expect to have datasets with large numbers of false outcomes, and a relatively smaller number of true outcomes. \n\nThe overall performance of any model trained on such data will be constrained by its ability to predict rare points. In problems where these rare points are only equally important or perhaps less important than non-rare points, this constraint may only become significant in the later \"tuning\" stages of building the model. But in problems where the rare points are important, or even the _point_ of the classifier (as in a cancer example), dealing with their scarcity is a first-order concern for the mode builder.\n\nTangentially, note that the relative importance of performance on rare observations should inform your choice of error metric for the problem you are working on; the more important they are, the more your metric should penalize underperformance on them. See my previous [Model Fit Metrics](https://www.kaggle.com/residentmario/model-fit-metrics/) and [Log Loss](https://www.kaggle.com/residentmario/log-loss-with-new-york-city-building-sales/) notebooks for slightly more detail on which error metrics do and don't care about this problem.\n\nSeveral different techniques exist in the practice for dealing with imbalanced dataset. The most naive class of techniques is **sampling**: changing the data presented to the model by undersampling common classes, oversampling (duplicating) rare classes, or both.\n\n## Motivation\n\nWe'll motivate why under- and over- sampling is useful with an example. The following visualization shows the radical effect that the relative number of points-per-class in a dataset has on classification as performed by a (linear-kernel) Support Vector Machine (for a quick primer on SVMs check [here](https://www.kaggle.com/residentmario/primer-on-support-vector-machines)), shamelessly stolen from the `imbalanced-learn` documentation [here](http://contrib.scikit-learn.org/imbalanced-learn/stable/auto_examples/over-sampling/plot_comparison_over_sampling.html)."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"f0d71460-e738-4c4c-9b14-835fb7c3cf3d","_uuid":"ebc39b50569bc10618c827e6e71538690f56afc7","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sklearn.svm import LinearSVC\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import Counter\nfrom sklearn.datasets import make_classification\n\ndef create_dataset(n_samples=1000, weights=(0.01, 0.01, 0.98), n_classes=3,\n                   class_sep=0.8, n_clusters=1):\n    return make_classification(n_samples=n_samples, n_features=2,\n                               n_informative=2, n_redundant=0, n_repeated=0,\n                               n_classes=n_classes,\n                               n_clusters_per_class=n_clusters,\n                               weights=list(weights),\n                               class_sep=class_sep, random_state=0)\n\ndef plot_decision_function(X, y, clf, ax):\n    plot_step = 0.02\n    x_min, x_max = X[:, 0].min() - 1, X[:, 0].max() + 1\n    y_min, y_max = X[:, 1].min() - 1, X[:, 1].max() + 1\n    xx, yy = np.meshgrid(np.arange(x_min, x_max, plot_step),\n                         np.arange(y_min, y_max, plot_step))\n\n    Z = clf.predict(np.c_[xx.ravel(), yy.ravel()])\n    Z = Z.reshape(xx.shape)\n    ax.contourf(xx, yy, Z, alpha=0.4)\n    ax.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], alpha=0.8, c=y, edgecolor='k')\n    \nfig, ((ax1, ax2), (ax3, ax4)) = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(15, 12))\n\nax_arr = (ax1, ax2, ax3, ax4)\nweights_arr = ((0.01, 0.01, 0.98), (0.01, 0.05, 0.94),\n               (0.2, 0.1, 0.7), (0.33, 0.33, 0.33))\nfor ax, weights in zip(ax_arr, weights_arr):\n    X, y = create_dataset(n_samples=1000, weights=weights)\n    clf = LinearSVC().fit(X, y)\n    plot_decision_function(X, y, clf, ax)\n    ax.set_title('Linear SVC with y={}'.format(Counter(y)))","execution_count":67,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"af033a27-9311-425b-bf0d-d251a528d94e","_uuid":"c240d87da1a337435d892a5d71a453e0ee5e51cb"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As you can see, when a dataset is dominated by one or few classes, to the exclusion of some other classes, the optimal solution can break down to collapse: a model which simply classifies all or most points in the majority class (as in the first and second visualizations in this grid).

A way of quantifying this hope is to look at a **learning curve**.\n\nA learning curve illustrates the level of fit of a model as we increase the number of observations we show it. I gave a very brief demo on learning curves in [a previous notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/residentmario/learning-curves-with-zillow-economics-data/), and if you're totally unfamiliar with them I suggest taking a look at that first.\n\nWe can generate a learning curve for any sampling method by training a simple model on an incrementally larger number of sampled points, then scoring the resulting model on the full test set.

Hence if under-sampling helps significantly with our rare-point bias problem, it is well worth doing!\n\nBuilding and checking the sample learning curve is easy and well worth doing.

The plot here is actually showing just the first of these ten different samples. You can change the number of times this is done using the `n_subsets` parameter.\n\nAnother thing `EasyEnsemble` allows is sampling with replacement.\n\nBy default `EasyEnsemble` is the same as `RandomUnderSampler`, it reduces the counts of each of the classes down to the count of the smallest constituent class. Since class 3 had just 64 observations, we ended up with a sample which has 64 observations per class. This reduces the shape of our dataset from `(5000, 2)` way down to `(192, 2)` per sample. The API for adjusting this is the same: use the `ratio` parameter, passing in a `dict` with the desired number of observations per class.\n\nHowever, I find the `EasyEnsemble` API hard to use, because it doesn't allow automatically combining oversampling with undersampling, e.g. oversampling one category and undersampling another. There is however one `EasyEnsemble` feature that is not available in the raw sampler methods, which is sampling with replacement (`replacement=True`). I'm dubious as to the utility of this feature, but it exists.\n\nThe other method you can use is `BalanceCascade`. `BalanceCascade` is a computational adaptation of `EasyEnsemble`. You feed it an estimator, and that estimator is used to predict output classes. When observations from the dataset are sampled, observations which are misclassified are replaced in the dataset, and those which aren't are not. The end result is a set of samples biased towards (duplicated) poorly classifiable observations.\n\n`EasyEsnemble` allows you to over/under-sample with or without replacement, `BalanceCascade` allows you to over/under-sample with smart replacement (at least that's what the `sklearn` documentation calls this technique). This is an interesting resampling technique if you are interested in working on problem point performance while working with rare classes. It allows you to, in a sense, test the numerical stability of the classifier you have built, by re-training it on a set of points that it is known to have trouble with (and then checking the difference).\n\nI again find this API difficult-to-use, however."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"bf49eb0f-3750-4ed3-b32f-640c2ea75296","_uuid":"97c4801cae4ee26423e297f773e1ab4453aeb78d","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from imblearn.ensemble import BalanceCascade\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nbc = BalanceCascade(random_state=0,\n                    estimator=LogisticRegression(random_state=0),\n                    n_max_subset=10)\nbc.fit(X, y)\nX_resampled, y_resampled = bc.sample(X, y)\ncolors = ['#ef8a62' if v == 0 else '#f7f7f7' if v == 1 else '#67a9cf' for v in y_resampled[0, :]]\nplt.scatter(X_resampled[0, :, 0], X_resampled[0, :, 1], c=colors, linewidth=1, edgecolor='black')\nsns.despine()","execution_count":76,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"72c326e6-aa56-485e-b444-2e221f0b2b29","_uuid":"afa6529f5a0e5e0368f4e75f602991d4781c39c5"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Application\n\nSo far we've motivated the case for sampling your data and introduced under- and over- sampling facilities in `sklearn`.

Other approaches to class imbalance problems include custom error functions (designing your own kernel for the SVM for instance), and other approaches to sampling include more involved algorithms like SMOTE and other toys. I plan on covering some of this in later notebooks.\n\nInterested in learning more about sampling?
