        "The purpose of this experiment is to show how heuristics such as [Simulated Annealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing \"Simulated Annealing\") can be used to find efficiently good combinations of hyper-parameters in machine learning algorithms. This approach is better than blind random generation of parameters. It is also preferable to fine-tuning each hyper-parameter separately because typically there are interactions between them. \n",

IEEE, 2015](http://www.oliviercaelen.be/doc/SSCI_calib_final.pdf \"Original paper\"). There is a Time variable (seconds from the first transaction in the dataset), an Amount variable, the Class variable (1=fraud, 0= no fraud) and the rest (V1-V28) are factor variables obtained through Principal Components Analysis from the original variables.\n",

The idea is that we start with a high temperature and \"bad\" solutions are easily accepted at first, in the hope of exploring wide areas of the search space. But as the temperature drops, bad solutions are less likely to be accepted and the search becomes more focused.      \n",

We set these average probabilities to be around 50% during the first, second,...,fifth 20 iterations respectively and we use Excel Solver to find suitable parameters.
