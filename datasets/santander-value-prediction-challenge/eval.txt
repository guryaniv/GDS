The evaluation metric for this competition is Root Mean Squared Logarithmic
Error. The RMSLE is calculated as ϵ= √ 1 n n ∑ i=1 (log(pi+1)−log(ai+1))2
Where: ϵ is the RMSLE value (score) n is the total number of observations in
the (public/private) data set, pi is your prediction of target, and ai is the
actual target for i . log(x) is the natural logarithm of x Submission File For
every row in the test.csv, submission files should contain two columns: ID and
target. The ID corresponds to the column of that ID in the test.tsv. The file
should contain a header and have the following format: ID,target
