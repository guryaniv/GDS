So expand the mask a little :)\n",

If the patient has a [tracheostomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheotomy), this will not be the case, I do not know whether this is present in the dataset. Also, particulary noisy images (for instance due to a pacemaker in the image below) this method may also fail. Instead, the second largest air pocket in the body will be segmented. You can recognize this by checking the fraction of image that the mask corresponds to, which will be very small for this case. You can then first apply a morphological closing operation with a kernel a few mm in size to close these holes, after which it should work (or more simply, do not use the mask for this image). \n",
