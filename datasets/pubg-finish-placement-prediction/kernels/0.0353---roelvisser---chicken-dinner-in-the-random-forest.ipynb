The features with the highest linear correlation are\n1.  walkDistance (0.81)\n2. killPlace (-0.71)\n3. boosts (0.62)\n4. weaponsAcquired (0.57)\n5. damageDealt (0.44)\n\nSo you win by walking? Actually, my view point is that walking distance is a measure for the amount of time you have been alive. Survive longer and you have a higher chance on a higher ranking. Same explanation for the number of weapons acquired. Kill place is negatively correlated because a lower number means more kills. More kills probably means a higher win place, although the number of kills actually does not make the top 5! I think the kill place generalizes better than the actual number of kills. In 1 game the winner may have had 20 kills, while in another game the winner may only have 10 kills, which results in a large spread on a linear fit. For both the 20 and 10 kills the winners may have achieved killPlace = 1.\n\n**Kills** correlates quite well with anything kill related:\n1. damageDealt (0.89)\n2. killStreak (0.80)\n3.
