A \"security master\" refers to reference data about the lifetime of a particular asset, tracking ticker changes, name changes, etc over time. In finance, raw information is typically uninteresting and uninformative and you need to do substantial feature engineering and create either or both of time series and cross-sectional features.  However **to do that without error requires that you deeply understand the nature of the asset universe.** This is not exciting fancy data science, but absolutely essential. Kaggle competitions are usually won in the third or fourth decimal place of the score so every detail matters.\n\n### What are some questions we want to answer?\n\n**Is `assetCode` a unique and permanent identifier?**\n\nIf you group by `assetCode` and make time-series features are you assured to be referencing the same instrument? In the real world, the ticker symbol is not guaranteed to refer to the same company over time. Data providers usually provide a \"permanent ID\" so that you can keep track of this over time. This is not provided here (although in fact both Intrinio and Reuters provide this in the for sale version of the data used in this competition).\n\nThe rules state:\n\n> Each asset is identified by an assetCode (note that a single company may have multiple assetCodes). Depending on what you wish to do, you may use the assetCode, assetName, or time as a way to join the market data to news data.\n\n>assetCode(object) - a unique id of an asset\n\nSo is it unique or not and can we join time series features **always** over time on `assetCode`?\n\n**What about `assetName`?  Is that unique or do names change over time?**\n\n>assetName(category) - the name that corresponds to a group of assetCodes. These may be \"Unknown\" if the corresponding assetCode does not have any rows in the news data.\n\n**What is the nature of missing data? What does it mean when data is missing?**\n\n\nLet's explore and see.\n\n\n\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Make environment and get data\nfrom kaggle.competitions import twosigmanews\nenv = twosigmanews.make_env()\n(market_train_df, news_train_df) = env.get_training_data()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"089d1853927f0a6ed00b187c79e0d00fee949726"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"[](http://)Let's define a valid \"has_data\" day for each asset if there is reported trading `volume` for the day."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"6689b1aa6409dc5cc4ef574ff158f0d2564f11c1"},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = market_train_df\ndf['has_data'] = df.volume.notnull().astype('int')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"3a7629268d2c7625245dacce1be61af97c5b1701"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"And let's see how long an asset is \"alive\" by the\n- the distance betwen the first reported data point and last\n- and the number of days in that distance that actually has data"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"df3a0553cb848a0ea52d11121617d73fc35f7cef"},"cell_type":"code","source":"lifetimes_df = df.groupby(\n        by='assetCode'\n    ).agg(\n        {'time': [np.min, np.max],\n         'has_data': 'sum'\n        }\n)\nlifetimes_df.columns = lifetimes_df.columns.droplevel()\nlifetimes_df.rename(columns={'sum': 'has_data_sum'}, inplace=True)\nlifetimes_df['days_alive'] = np.busday_count(\n    lifetimes_df.amin.values.astype('datetime64[D]'),\n    lifetimes_df.amax.values.astype('datetime64[D]')\n)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"af4527cb138d6a9d26ee9a3e0e266014c8a81bfa"},"cell_type":"code","source":"#plt.hist(lifetimes_df.days_alive.astype('int'), bins=25);\n#plt.title('Histogram of Asset Lifetimes (business days)');\ndata = [go.Histogram(x=lifetimes_df.days_alive.astype('int'))]\nlayout = dict(title='Histogram of Asset Lifetimes (business days)',\n              xaxis=dict(title='Business Days'),\n              yaxis=dict(title='Asset Count')\n             )\nfig = dict(data = data, layout = layout)\niplot(fig)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"7bff21ab95f5ec8f39c83dce1acd6de62edb0428"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This was shocking to me.

Long-horizon features like, say, 12m momentum, may not produce sufficient asset coverage to be useful becuase so much data is missing.\n- The fact that an asset is missing data *is not informative in itself*; it is an artifact of the data collection and delivery process. For example, you cannot calcuate a true asset \"age\" (e.g., hypothesizing that days since IPO is a valid feature) and use that as a factor. This is unfortunate becuase you may hypothesize that news impact is a bigger driver of return variance during the early part of an asset's life due to lack of analyst coverage, lack of participation by quants, etc.\n- `assetCode` is not consistent across time; the same economic entity can, and in many cases does, have a different `assetCode`; `assetCode` is not a permanent identifier.\n- `assetName` while consistent across time, can refer to more than once stock *at the same time* and therefore cannot be used to make time series features; `assetName` is not a unique permanent identifier.\n- Missing time series data does not show up as `NaN` on the trading calendar; rather the rows are just missing. As such, to make time series features, you have to be careful with pandas rolling calculations and roll on calendar days, not naively on the count of rows.\n\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"338ef2bd320f3a06da213c02eb074adf026e19ae"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
