Context High-quality financial data is expensive to acquire and is therefore
rarely shared for free. Here I provide the full historical daily price and
volume data for all US-based stocks and ETFs trading on the NYSE, NASDAQ, and
NYSE MKT. It's one of the best datasets of its kind you can obtain. Content
The data (last updated 11/10/2017) is presented in CSV format as follows:
Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, OpenInt. Note that prices have been
adjusted for dividends and splits. Acknowledgements This dataset belongs to
me. Iâ€™m sharing it here for free. You may do with it as you wish. Inspiration
Many have tried, but most have failed, to predict the stock market's ups and
downs. Can you do any better?
