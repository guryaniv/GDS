Note: Self inflicted damage is subtracted.\n5. **headshotKills** - Number of enemy players killed with headshots.\n6. **heals** - Number of healing items used.\n7. **killPlace** - Ranking in match of number of enemy players killed.\n8. **killPoints** - Kills-based external ranking of player. (Think of this as an Elo ranking where only kills matter.)\n9. **killStreaks** - Max number of enemy players killed in a short amount of time.\n10. **kills** - Number of enemy players killed.\n11. **longestKill** - Longest distance between player and player killed at time of death. This may be misleading, as downing a player and driving away may lead to a large longestKill stat.\n12. **matchId** - Integer ID to identify match. There are no matches that are in both the training and testing set.\n13. **revives** - Number of times this player revived teammates.\n14. **rideDistance** - Total distance traveled in vehicles measured in meters.\n15. **roadKills** - Number of kills while in a vehicle.\n16. **swimDistance** - Total distance traveled by swimming measured in meters.\n17. **teamKills** - Number of times this player killed a teammate.\n18. **vehicleDestroys** - Number of vehicles destroyed.\n19. **walkDistance** - Total distance traveled on foot measured in meters.\n20. **weaponsAcquired** - Number of weapons picked up.\n21. **winPoints** - Win-based external ranking of player. (Think of this as an Elo ranking where only winning matters.)\n22. **groupId** - Integer ID to identify a group within a match. If the same group of players plays in different matches, they will have a different groupId each time.\n23. **numGroups** - Number of groups we have data for in the match.\n24. **maxPlace** - Worst placement we have data for in the match. This may not match with numGroups, as sometimes the data skips over placements.\n26. **winPlacePerc** - The target of prediction. This is a percentile winning placement, where 1 corresponds to 1st place, and 0 corresponds to last place in the match. It is calculated off of maxPlace, not numGroups, so it is possible to have missing chunks in a match.\n\nInitial hypotheses/questions to solve with data:\n1. More boosts used is related to a higher final position.\n2. More heals used is related to a higher final position.\n3. Is camper style effective?\n4.
