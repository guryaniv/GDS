Although the dataset is large, this is an approachable problem and as usual with Kaggle competitions, provides realistic practice for building a machine learning solution. The best way to learn is by doing, so let's work through a complete machine learning problem!\n\nGreat resources for Kaggle competitions are the [discussion forums](https://www.kaggle.com/c/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction/discussion) and the [kernels](https://www.kaggle.com/c/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction/kernels) completed by other data scientists.

It's not the best measure because the taxis do not travel along lines, but it's more accurate in terms of an absolute distance than the Manhattan and Euclidean distances made from the absolute latitude and longitude difference. The Manhattan and Euclidean distances are relative and do not take into account the spherical shape of the Earth. \n\n(We could convert the latitude and longitude into cartesian coordinates after establishing an origin. One option would be to use the center of the Earth and another would be to use the average of all coordinates in the data as an origin.

This is adapted from the excellent fast.ai library, in particular, the structured module (available at https://github.com/fastai/fastai/blob/master/fastai/structured.py).

For now, I have decided not to use these attributes. For more information on datetimes in Pandas, refer to [the documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/timeseries.html).\n\n### Fractional Time Variables\n\nFinally, I add a number of other calculations that combine existing measures to create fractional variables:\n\n* Fractional time of day\n* Fractional time of week\n* Fractional time of month\n* Fractional time of year\n\nThese are all measured from 0 - 1 in units of whichever time period we are measuring on. The idea behind these variables is that they can take the place of several other time indicators. For example, instead of using the `Dayof week`, `Hour`, `Minute`, and `Second`, we can use the fractional time of the week to find out precisely when the observation takes place in the week.\n\nI have found that the fractional time variables work well in practice especially with non-linear models. When we use linear models, a good approach is [cyclical variable encoding](https://ianlondon.github.io/blog/encoding-cyclical-features-24hour-time/) of time features, but I haven't found this to be necessary with non-linear models. Again, you'll have to experiment with different approaches to find what works best!

However, this won't improve the generalization performance, which is the goal of machine learning: build a model that generalizes to new data! You can also submit the predictions from this notebook and try to better the testing predictions. I look forward to seeing what you can come up with.\n\nI'm working on some more notebooks with additional performance gains, but see if you can take these methods and improve! To wrap up, here are my recommendations:\n\n1. Train with more data\n2. Experiment with different methods for filtering outliers\n3. Find an optimal set of features or build more features\n4. Hyperparameter tuning of the random forest\n5. Try more complex models such as the gradient boosting machine\n\nI have to add that these are all __potential__ improvements because of course we don't know if they will work until we try! I wish you the best of luck, and I'll be back in another kernel trying some improvements of my own. \n\nBest,\n\nWill"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false,"_uuid":"485197f6b91e2a6e20e4c5ea9a6b3704f53ca1c1"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.6.5"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
