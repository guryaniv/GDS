Submissions are evaluated on SMAPE between forecasts and actual values. We
define SMAPE = 0 when the actual and predicted values are both 0. Submission
File For each article and day combination (see key.csv), you must predict the
web traffic. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

file size and number of rows, submissions may take a few minutes to score.
