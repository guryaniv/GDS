The entire sentence needs to be converted in the form of small tokens or into individual words. By doing this it helps us to assign each word with a unique integer value called as index or ID of that word.**\n\n**2. Tokenization also helps us to find the total number of unique words in our vocabulary which is later to be fed in our model.**\n\n**3. Once the tokenization is done, the next common step is to remove stopwords. Stopwords are the the most commonly occuring words in our vocabulary. Words that won't generally matter even if they are taken out from our vocabulary. For example words like 'the', 'and', 'so', 'if' etc are the stopwords. But we don't always have to remove the stopwords. Stopwords are only removed when their absence won't affect our model prediction much, in cases like classification of documents according to the topics, stopwords can be removed as we only have to focus on words that carry more importance in our documents.**\n\n**4.
