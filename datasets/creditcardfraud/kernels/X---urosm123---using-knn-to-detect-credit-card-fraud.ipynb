In an unbalanced dataset as this one, we are looking for 'needles in a haystack'. Hence, missing cases of fraudulent transactions is more detrimental than falsely identifying valid transactions as fraudulent, given that in practice the investigation into a transaction (once identified as fraudulent by the alogrithm) can occur with adidtional information; ie. we would have more 'needles' to inspect. However, if the the prediction was a False Negative, then our algorithm has identified it as a valid transaction and we cannot go into further detail to ultimately achieve the goal of being able to identify fraudulent credit card transactions."]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {"_cell_guid": "44e71cf7-1487-4e9d-9e04-92f5efdc8877", "_uuid": "ede24127ad24c6be7e770d36393f08933f9ad112"}, "source": ["**Possible Next Steps **\n", "\n", "Looking back into the visualization of the PCA components above, there are a few '+' cases that are on their 'own'; (do not have 3 or more positive cases surrounding them for a correct classification vote using 5 nearest neighbors).

If we seperate the data in this way before applying the nearest neighbor algorithm, then there exists the possibility that we would remove 'wrong' votes and thus reduce the count of False Negatives. At the same time, removing valid cases before voting would increase the chance for False Positives as well (which would be O.K. given our error threshohld preferences). Ultimately, if the decrease in False Negatives is larger than the increase in False Positives, then the SVM layer would be beneficial to the algorithm. Furthermore, the high dimensionality of the data-set is not ideal for the algorithm in terms of prediction speed, so being able to eliminate certain data-points could prove useful. Equally, we can try to identify certain PCA components that do not significantly alter the performance of the predictor and remove them from the training and testing data as a part of the pre-processing."]}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "version": "3.6.4", "file_extension": ".py", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "pygments_lexer": "ipython3"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
