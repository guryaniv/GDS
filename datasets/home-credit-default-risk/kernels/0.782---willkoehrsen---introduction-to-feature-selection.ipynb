We will reduce the number of features using several methods and then we will test the performance of the features using a fairly basic gradient boosting machine model. \n\nThe main takeaways from this notebook are:\n\n* Going from 1465 total features to 536 and an AUC ROC of 0.783 on the public leaderboard\n* A further optional step to go to 342 features and an AUC ROC of 0.782\n\nThe full set of features was built in [Part One](https://www.kaggle.com/willkoehrsen/introduction-to-manual-feature-engineering) and [Part Two](https://www.kaggle.com/willkoehrsen/introduction-to-manual-feature-engineering-p2) of Manual Feature Engineering\n\nWe will use three methods for feature selection:\n\n1. Remove collinear features\n2. Remove features with greater than a threshold percentage of missing values\n3. Keep only the most relevant features using feature importances from a model\n\nWe will also take a look at an example of applying PCA although we will not use this method for feature reduction.

Well, it seems simple, at least until we have to decide what percentage of missing values is the minimum threshold for removing a column.

In this implementation, if any columns have greater than 75% missing values, they will be removed. \n\nMost models (including those in Sk-Learn) cannot handle missing values, so we will have to fill these in before machine learning. The Gradient Boosting Machine ([at least in LightGBM](https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM/blob/master/docs/Advanced-Topics.rst)) can handle missing values. Imputing missing values always makes me a little uncomfortable because we are adding information that actually isn't in the dataset.

Tree-based models (and consequently ensembles of trees) can determine an \"importance\" for each feature by measuring the reduction in impurity for including the feature in the model. I'm not really sure what that means (any explanations would be welcome) and the absolute value of the importance can be difficult to interpret. However, the relative value of the importances can be used as an approximation of the \"relevance\" of different features in a model. Moreover, we can use the feature importances to remove features that the model does not consider important. \n\nOne method for doing this automatically is the [Recursive Feature Elimination method](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.RFE.html) in Scikit-Learn. This accepts an estimator (one that either returns feature weights such as a linear regression, or feature importances such as a random forest) and a desired number of features. In then fits the model repeatedly on the data and iteratively removes the lowest importance features until the desired number of features is left. This means we have another arbitrary hyperparameter to use in out pipeline: the number of features to keep! \n\nInstead of doing this automatically, we can perform our own feature removal by first removing all zero importance features from the model. If this leaves too many features, then we can consider removing the features with the lowest importance. We will use a Gradient Boosted Model from the LightGBM library to assess feature importances. If you're used to the Scikit-Learn library, the LightGBM library has an API that makes deploying the model very similar to using a Scikit-Learn model.

There are many other methods such as:\n\n* PCA: Principle Components Analysis (PCA)\n* ICA: Independent Components Analysis (ICA)\n* Manifold learning: [also called non-linear dimensionality reduction](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/247907/what-is-the-difference-between-manifold-learning-and-non-linear-dimensionality-r)\n\nPCA is a great method for reducing the number of features provided that you do not care about model interpretability. It projects the original set of features onto a lower dimension, in the process, eliminating any physical representation behind the features. Here's a pretty thorough introduction to the math for anyone interested. PCA also assumes that the data is Gaussian distributed, which may not be the case, especially when dealing with real-world human generated data. \n\nICA representations also obscure any physical meaning behind the variables and presevere the most \"independent\" dimensions of the data (which is different than the dimensions with the most variance). \n\nManifold learning is more often used for low-dimensional visualizations (such as with T-SNE or LLE) rather than for dimensionality reduction for a classifier. These methods are heavily dependent on several hyperparameters and are not deterministic which means that there is no way to apply it to new data (in other words you cannot `fit` it to the training data and then separately `transform` the testing data). The learned representation of a dataset will change every time you apply manifold learning so it is not generally a stable method for feature selection."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"be760a6dd27ed9a4bcc3040953ffd5b5a4b87877"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## PCA Example\n\nWe can go through a quick example to show how PCA is implemented. Without going through too many details, PCA finds a new set of axis (the principal components) that maximize the amount of variance captured in the data. The original data is then projected down onto these principal components. The idea is that we can use fewer principal components than the original number of features while still capturing most of the variance. PCA is implemented in Scikit-Learn in the same way as preprocessing methods. We can either select the number of new components, or the fraction of variance we want explained in the data. If we pass in no argument, the number of principal components will be the same as the number of original features. We can then use the `variance_explained_ratio_` to determine the number of components needed for different threshold of variance retained."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"abd2c85ee9efd0c28afe9a27fb4cc283ce987f18","trusted":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.decomposition import PCA\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import Imputer\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\n\n# Make sure to drop the ids and target\ntrain = train.drop(columns = ['SK_ID_CURR', 'TARGET'])\ntest = test.drop(columns = ['SK_ID_CURR'])\n\n# Make a pipeline with imputation and pca\npipeline = Pipeline(steps = [('imputer', Imputer(strategy = 'median')),\n             ('pca', PCA())])\n\n# Fit and transform on the training data\ntrain_pca = pipeline.fit_transform(train)\n\n# transform the testing data\ntest_pca = pipeline.transform(test)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"5fb2b6315382ab104c8d9dcef031931fd6cbdb9d","trusted":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Extract the pca object\npca = pipeline.named_steps['pca']\n\n# Plot the cumulative variance explained\n\nplt.figure(figsize = (10, 8))\nplt.plot(list(range(train.shape[1])), np.cumsum(pca.explained_variance_ratio_), 'r-')\nplt.xlabel('Number of PC'); plt.ylabel('Cumulative Variance Explained');\nplt.title('Cumulative Variance Explained with PCA');","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"1c0152d9589f7ba1717b49ef320eee64f50a0025"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We only need a few prinicipal components to account for the majority of variance in the data.

These methods are necessary to reduce the number of features to increase model interpretability, decrease model runtime, and increase generalization performance on the test set. The methods of feature selection we used are:\n\n1. Remove highly collinear variables as measured by a correlation coefficient greater than 0.9\n2. Remove any columns with more than 75% missing values.\n3. Remove any features with a zero importance as determined by a gradient boosting machine.\n4. (Optional) keep only enough features to account for 95% of the importance in the gradient boosting machine.\n\nUsing the first three methods, we reduced the number of features from __1465__ to __536__ with a 5-fold cv AUC ROC score of 0.7838 and a public leaderboard score of 0.783.\n\nAfter applying the fourth method, we end up with 342 features with a 5-fold cv AUC SCORE of 0.7482 and a public leaderboard score of 0.782. \n\nGoing forward, we might actually want to add _more_ features except this time, instead of naively applying aggregations, think about what features are actually important from a domain point of view. There are a number of kernels that have created useful features that we can add to our set here to improve performance. The process of feature engineering - feature selection is iterative, and it may require several more passes before we get it completely right!
