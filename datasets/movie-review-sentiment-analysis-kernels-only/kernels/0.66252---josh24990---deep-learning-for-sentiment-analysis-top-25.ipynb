This CNN-LSTM model consists of an initial LSTM layer which will receive word embeddings for each token in the review as inputs. The intuition is that its output tokens will store information not only of the initial token, but also any previous tokens; In other words, the LSTM layer is generating a new encoding for the original input. The output of the LSTM layer is then fed into a convolution layer which we expect will extract local features. Finally the convolution layer’s output will be pooled to a smaller dimension and ultimately outputted as either a positive or negative label.\n\nI must credit the following source which introduces the idea of LSTM-CNN Model for Sentiment Analysis.

These are areas that I may return to in futurel; they may even be of interest to you, too.\n\nLast up, please feel free to offer any feedback on the approach/code within this Kernel.
