As with nearly all challenges including image data, I will be deploying a Neural Network in order to solve it, specifically, a convolutional neural network. I'll provide a running commentary as I work through this project so it's hopefully easy to follow and, can serve as a helpful for newbies to Deep Learning. \n\nI personally think it's important to encourage uptake in Deep Learning, not least because Neural Networks are so effective at solving almost any data problem (usually out-performing shallow models along the way), but also because to the beginner, it can appear a daunting field. I truely believe that anyone can pick up and master Deep Learning with the right resources, and I hope this work can go some of the way to help those readers who are on a similar journey as me to understand, grasp and utilise some of the core concepts.\n\nI hope you enjoy the read, and please feel free to leave any questions that you may have.\n\n<i>Additional note: At the time of posting, this model scores in the top 8% of the Leaderboard. Getting into the top 5% would be nice so maybe one day I'll come back and attempt to crack it!</i>"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d91c77bf0dcec59678f4f943b27deff84e75356f"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1.

Reference to the above image, this could be a Deep Convolutional Network. \n\nThe fundamental difference between a more standard densely connected layer and a convolution layer is this: Dense layers learn global patterns in their input feature space (for example, for a MNIST digit, patterns involving all pixels), whereas convolution layers learn local patterns: in the case of images, patterns found in small 2D windows of the inputs. \n\nThis key characteristic gives convnets two interesting properties:\n1. <b>The patterns they learn are translation invariant:</b> After learning a certain pattern in the lower-right corner of a picture, a convolutional network can recognize it anywhere: for example, in the upper-left corner. A densely connected network would have to learn the pattern anew if it appeared at a new location. This makes convolutional networks data efficient when processing images (because the visual world is fundamentally translation invariant): they need fewer training samples to learn representations that have generalization power.\n2. <b>They can learn spatial hierarchies of patterns:</b> A first convolution layer will learn small local patterns such as edges, a second convolution layer will learn larger patterns made of the features of the first layers, and so on. This allows the network to efficiently learn increasingly complex and abstract visual concepts (because the visual world is fundamentally spatially hierarchical).\n\nI won't spend any more time dicsussing the model architecture here, however if you are interested in learning more, find below a few articles that really helped to cement my understanding of how Convolutional Networks specifically help to solve Computer Vision problems:\n1. https://medium.com/technologymadeeasy/the-best-explanation-of-convolutional-neural-networks-on-the-internet-fbb8b1ad5df8\n2. https://medium.freecodecamp.org/an-intuitive-guide-to-convolutional-neural-networks-260c2de0a050\n3. https://towardsdatascience.com/components-of-convolutional-neural-networks-6ff66296b456"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"05e7006022437d6e0d428843359c88123db338b4"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Define model architecture\nI'll now walk through my final chosen Convolutional Neural Network step by step.\n\nA common framework for CNN's is as follows:\n<b>Conv -> Conv -> Pool -> Conv -> Pool -> FC -> FC -> FC -> Softmax</b>\n\nI aim to follow this guideline as much as possible, with a bit of flexing which basically results from trial and error.\n\nThe very first step prior to defining a convolutional layer is to define a sequential model in Keras.

The model will be fit using the 'fit_generator' function since it will include additional augmented data. I'll start with a batch size of 86 (feel free to choose another). I'd also like the model to run over 100 epochs (or iterations), although it is quite likely to converge before this limit.

With minimal set-up, a relatively standard convolutional model archictecture and some added gizmo's in the shape of data augmentation and a learning rate callback, the current model is able to predict handwritten 0-9 digits to ~99% accuracy. In terms of the model's performance relative to others on Kaggle, it features in/around the <b>top 8%</b> on the Leaderboard, which i'm really pleased with. There are more ways in which the model could be improved even further, perhaps i'll come back to these in the future.\n\nIn the meantime, I hope you've enjoyed the read and found the contents helpful. Share an upvote or comment if it did help you, it's always nice to hear. And of course for any questions or suggested improvements, i'm more than happy to hear about these too, so please fire away if you have them! Thanks again for reading and happy Kaggling."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
