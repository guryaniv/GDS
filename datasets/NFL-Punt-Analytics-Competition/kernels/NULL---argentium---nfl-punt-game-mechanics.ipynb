Play Mechanics:\n\nThe main objective of the American football is to score as many points as they can by bringing the ball into their respective touchdown zone. For each play, however, the sub-objectives vary according to the role of the team.\n\nThere are two possible team roles:\n1. Offensive\n2. Defensive\n\nIn general, the offensive team aims to score a goal by carrying the ball towards the touchdown zone. On the other hand, the defensive team must prevent the offensive team from scoring by tackling the ball carrier.\n\n### What is a Punt Play?\n\nThe Punt Play is a specialized play often performed when the offensive team risk losing possession of the ball. The main objective of the offensive team is to kick the ball as far back from the opponent's goal line. To put it simply, the Punt Coverage team might lose ball possession so they want to make it harder for the opponent to score a touchdown by putting more distance from their goal line.\n\nIn response the defensive team (Punt Return) attempts to catch the ball to gain possession and move it back as close to their goal line or even score a touchdown if possible.\n\nIn a way, Punt Play is special because both teams transition from different roles within a single play. When the Punt Return team (defensive) gains possession of the ball, they turn into an offensive mode while the Punt Coverage team (originally the offensive team) changes into a defensive role."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"5deec7f7357ae7a38b6a15396f9d6e3730c7653e"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Where do the they punt?

This increases the return outcomes compared to other outcomes.\n2. Special Cases\n    - I will explain this below.\n3. Fair Catch\n    - Interestingly, the fair catch is made when the yard line is farther from the team's goal line or closer to the opponent's goal line.\n        - Perhaps, there is less temptation to return.\n        - With less area to cover, there is more chance for the Punt Returner to catch the ball.\n4.

Touchback\n    - The touchbacks were made farther away from the team's goal line. This makes sense because it would be easier for the ball to reach the opponent's endzone.

Findings Summary:\n\n## 1. Coverage Formation Blocking\n\n- The wing positions are a weak spot of the coverage formation.\n\n### How are the injuries related to the team objectives?\n1. Coverage\n    - Team objective: Enable the Punter to freely kick by blocking the opponent.\n2. Return\n    - Team objective: Stop the Punt.\n\nIn simple terms, the Coverage blocks the Return team from stopping the punt\n\n## 2. PR-Related Injuries\n- The PR is the most frequently injured role and partner role in the injuries.\n- All tackling-tackled injuries are related to the PR.\n\n### How are the injuries related to the role of a Punt Returner?\nA punt returner:\n> \" specializes in returning punts\" -Wikipedia\n\nIn other words, the Punt Returner catches the ball and may run with it. This makes him the main target.\n\n## 3. Gunner-Related Injuries\n- The Gunner role is the 4th most likely to get injured.\n- The Gunner role is 2nd role most likely to injure others.\n\n### How are the injuries related to the role of a Gunner?\n\nA gunner:\n> \"specializes in running down the sideline very quickly in an attempt to tackle the kick or punt returner\" -Wikipedia\n\nThis means running fast is within his job description.\n\n## 4. Opponent Block Injuries\n- Without the PR-related injuries, most of the opponent injuries are related to blocks.\n- The block injuries are uniformly distributed after the kick.\n\n### How are the injuries related to the team objectives?\n1. Coverage\n    - The Coverage team must tackle the PR to prevent him from gaining yards.\n2. Return\n    - Hence, the Return team responds by blocking the Coverage team from reaching the PR.\n    \nIn simple terms, blocking is part of the game.\n\n## 5. Self-Inflicted Coverage Team Injuries\n- Most of the friendly fire injuries come from the coverage team.\n- The most common friendly-fire activity pairs come from similar activities.\n- The Coverage team's tackling is the most dangerous activity.\n- This is followed by getting blocked.\n\n### How are the injuries related to the individual's objectives?\nWe review the objectives of the teams.\n1. Coverage\n    - Team objective: Tackle the PR\n    - Personal objective: __Be the one to tackle the PR__\n2. Return\n    - Team objective: Gain yardage/Protect the PR\n    - Personal objective: Block the opponent\n\nIf we look at the difference between group objectives and personal objectives, the circumstances of the Coverage team makes them compete against each another. This can be observed in several videos where more than 1 Coverage team member tackled the PR.\nOn the other hand, the Return team is on a defensive mode, which makes them more careful and aware of each other.\n\nThe main issue here is similar to the bottleneck or single door crowd dynamics. In the single door crowd dynamics, the crowd accumulates because there is only one target location. Such situation increases the interaction between the people, which may result to injuries.\n\nReference:\n[Crowd Dynamics](http://www.gkstill.com/CV/PhD/Chapter3.html\n![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n\n----\nIn summary, the team and individual behaviors are driven by the game objectives.\n\nThis kernel explains the basics of the game mechanics and its relation to the injuries.\nThe movement dynamics would better explain how the execution of such behaviors lead to injuries. Since the NGS requires some heavy data processing, I separated it into another kernel.\n\nThis is the outline of the next kernel:\n1. Phase 1:\n    1. Coverage Formation Blocking\n2. Phase 2:\n    1. Punt Returner Collisions\n    2. Gunner Collisions\n    3. Block Opposition\n    4. Friendly-Fire Collisions (Without the Gunner)"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
