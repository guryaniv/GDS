Essentially, the ranking is transformed into a pairwise regression problem. The algorithm compares pairs of items and comes up with the optimal ordering for that pair, iterating through the different pairs to extrapolate with the final ranking of all items.\n\nThe business metric is the rank, not the MAE. Unfortunately, I've found the LGBM lambdarank implementation quite confusing and was unsuccessful at using it. As such we will optimize our algorithm using an MAE objective.\n\nLimitations using MAE:\n- The predictions are not bound, as such we can have some predictions falling above/below our percentile range\n- The predictions are not going to be unique, you could have several players/teams assigned same scores\n\n\n**Target variable:** Percentile\n\nIn a  game of PUBG, each team gets assigned a percentile value so there there should approximatly be the same cout of 0s, 0.5s, 1s etc. (there might be irregularities in the distribution due imbalance in team sizes or number of teams). We should expect to see a uniform distribution for all percentile scores value, and a gaussian distribution with mean 0.5 for the average percentile score per match.
