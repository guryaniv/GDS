Random forests? Cover trees? Not so fast, computer nerds. We're talking about
the real thing. In this competition you are asked to predict the forest cover
type (the predominant kind of tree cover) from cartographic variables. The
actual forest cover type for a given 30 x 30 meter cell was determined from US
Forest Service (USFS) Region 2 Resource Information System data. Independent
variables were then derived from data obtained from the US Geological Survey
and USFS. The data is in raw form and contains binary columns of data for
qualitative independent variables such as wilderness areas and soil type. This
study area includes four wilderness areas located in the Roosevelt National
Forest of northern Colorado. These areas represent forests with minimal human-
caused disturbances, so that existing forest cover types are more a result of
ecological processes rather than forest management practices. This competition
originally ran in 2015. We are relaunching it as a kernels-only version here.
