Ready to make a downpayment on your first house? Or looking to leverage the
equity in the home you have? To support needs for a range of financial
decisions, Santander Bank offers a lending hand to their customers through
personalized product recommendations. Under their current system, a small
number of Santanderâ€™s customers receive many recommendations while many others
rarely see any resulting in an uneven customer experience. In their second
competition, Santander is challenging Kagglers to predict which products their
existing customers will use in the next month based on their past behavior and
that of similar customers. With a more effective recommendation system in
place, Santander can better meet the individual needs of all customers and
ensure their satisfaction no matter where they are in life. Disclaimer: This
data set does not include any real Santander Spain's customer, and thus it is
not representative of Spain's customer base.
