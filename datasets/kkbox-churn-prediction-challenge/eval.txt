The evaluation metric for this competition is Log Loss logloss=− 1 N ∑ i=1 N (
y i log( p i )+(1− y i )log(1− p i )) where N is the number of observations,
log l is the natural logarithm, y i y is the binary target, and p i p is the
predicted probability that y i y equals 1. Note: the actual submitted
predicted probabilities are replaced with max(min(p,1− 10 −15 ), 10 −15 ) m .
Submission File For each user id (msno) in the test set, you must predict the
probability of churn (a number between 0 and 1). The file should contain a
header and have the following format: msno,is_churn
