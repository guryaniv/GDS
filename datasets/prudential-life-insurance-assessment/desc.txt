Picture this. You are a data scientist in a start-up culture with the
potential to have a very large impact on the business. Oh, and you are backed
up by a company with 140 years' business experience. Curious? Great! You are
the kind of person we are looking for. Prudential, one of the largest issuers
of life insurance in the USA, is hiring passionate data scientists to join a
newly-formed Data Science group solving complex challenges and identifying
opportunities. The results have been impressive so far but we want more. The
Challenge In a one-click shopping world with on-demand everything, the life
insurance application process is antiquated. Customers provide extensive
information to identify risk classification and eligibility, including
scheduling medical exams, a process that takes an average of 30 days. The
result? People are turned off. Thatâ€™s why only 40% of U.S. households own
individual life insurance. Prudential wants to make it quicker and less labor
intensive for new and existing customers to get a quote while maintaining
privacy boundaries. By developing a predictive model that accurately
classifies risk using a more automated approach, you can greatly impact public
perception of the industry. The results will help Prudential better understand
the predictive power of the data points in the existing assessment, enabling
us to significantly streamline the process.
