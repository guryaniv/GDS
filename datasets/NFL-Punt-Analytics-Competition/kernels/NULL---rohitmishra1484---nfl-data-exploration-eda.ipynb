For each injured player, the Primary Exposure is the impact that is observed to be markedly more severe than any other exposure during that play and was considered to be the primary source of the concussion. In some cases, the injury producing play can be identified, but the “Primary” event (helmet to helmet, helmet to body) cannot be identified. The “Primary Impact” will be listed as Unclear if the video coverage was adequate to observe all the events experienced by the player, but the competing exposures could not be differentiated to identify a primary. For plays in which the video coverage was not sufficient to visualize the player’s exposures, the primary exposure will be listed as Indeterminate. The data provided in the video review dataset will be only those for the primary impact.\n\nWithin the video review database, the prefix “Player” indicates the concussed player and “Partner” indicates the collision partner when applicable.
