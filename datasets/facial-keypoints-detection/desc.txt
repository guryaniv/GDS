The objective of this task is to predict keypoint positions on face images.
This can be used as a building block in several applications, such as:
tracking faces in images and video analysing facial expressions detecting
dysmorphic facial signs for medical diagnosis biometrics / face recognition
Detecing facial keypoints is a very challenging problem. Facial features vary
greatly from one individual to another, and even for a single individual,
there is a large amount of variation due to 3D pose, size, position, viewing
angle, and illumination conditions. Computer vision research has come a long
way in addressing these difficulties, but there remain many opportunities for
improvement. This getting-started competition provides a benchmark data set
and an R tutorial to get you going on analysing face images. Get started with
