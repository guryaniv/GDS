This will be an attempt to apply some of the principles we have learned in the course up to this point. We are only part way through the semester and this is an intorductory course to the topic, so I do not expect the world's greatest model. The goal instead is to simply apply what has been learned so far and create a model which is not too difficult to explain. As more complexity is gradually added to the model, cross validation will be performed to see any changes in the results. To help keep the code relatively organized, the data will be loaded and any imports will be done in the first block.
