Over and Undersampling (to be developed in the next version)\n\nFinally, we will quantify and illustrate the effects of the trade off between True Positive Rate and False Positive Rate using ROC and Precision/Recall (PR) curves, and disucss **why the popular ROC curve should not be used on highly imbalanced dataset** (or in general, why I prefer PR curves over ROC)."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"da93dae5-d8e0-9b89-0379-76074ca77b27","_uuid":"6e681939fa3408ed8bbd8ec588962277e76f79df"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Imports and reading in the data"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"8a4ced0e-e4d9-6dea-8f5d-25050112d2ad","_uuid":"1cc8a131bffc72dc8f1172e34f03d7215deec39a","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\npd.options.display.max_colwidth = 200\npd.options.display.max_columns = 200\nimport numpy as np\n\nimport time\n\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier,RandomForestClassifier,AdaBoostClassifier\nfrom sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_predict,cross_val_score,train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.metrics import classification_report,confusion_matrix,roc_curve,auc,precision_recall_curve,roc_curve\n\nimport os\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D\nimport seaborn as sns\n%matplotlib inline","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"d9bd3e21-f2e6-6a32-6514-e2e08c02b118","_uuid":"580ae30822d27baf00f904b62cd354e97fa62fa9","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv('../input/creditcard.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"f6aa59c8-ae9e-2ad7-3c1a-60234b249371","_uuid":"1a1d7a54d35cee9fc6d7a84ce133c9d15d5eb327"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The data has a column called 'Time', which are seconds from which the very first data observation took place.

This is due to the high class imbalance in our data. ROC curve is not a good visual illustration for highly imbalanced data, because the False Positive Rate ( False Positives / Total Real Negatives ) does not drop drastically when the Total Real Negatives is huge.\n\nWhereas Precision ( True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives) ) is highly sensitive to False Positives and is not impacted by a large total real negative denominator. \n\nThe biggest difference among the models are at around 0.8 recall rate. Seems like a lower weight, i.e. 5 and 10, out performs other weights significantly at 0.8 recall. This means that with those specific weights, our model can detect frauds fairly well (catching 80% of fraud) while not annoying a bunch of customers with false positives with an equally high precision of 80%.\n\nWithout further tuning our model, and of course we should do cross validation for any real model tuning/validation, it seems like a vanilla Logistic Regression is stuck at around 0.8 Precision and Recall. \n\nSo how do we know if we should sacrifice our precision for more recall, i.e. catching fraud? That is where data science meets your core business parameters. If the cost of missing a fraud highly outweighs the cost of canceling a bunch of legit customer transactions, i.e. false positives, then perhaps we can choose a weight that gives us a higher recall rate. Or maybe catching 80% of fraud is good enough for your business if you can minimize also minimize the \"user friction\" or credit card disruptions by keeping our precision high."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"1edb4ee8-2601-1a52-475c-3cca531d7723","_uuid":"d85814b6eb981b2329b868ff3a1c9e57ef40bcf1","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"_change_revision":0,"_is_fork":false,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
