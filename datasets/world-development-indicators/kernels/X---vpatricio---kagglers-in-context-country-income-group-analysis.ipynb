Indeed, it seems that the most necessary condition to have a lot of kagglers per habitant in a country is to be a rich country (high GDP). And yes, correlation does not mean causation, but it seems to me more reasonable that rich countries can provide conditions for people to kaggle, than kagglers, which are only a small fraction of the population, can strongly influence the GDP.\n\nOn the other hand, no countries with a high degree of inequality (Gini > 45, bottom left panel) have a high kaggler density. However,  more egalitarian countries can have both a high or low kaggler density, probably because the Gini index is somehow correlated with 'richness' (red dots prefer to live in the left of that plot). And this tells you something quite important: **these variables are all correlated**! Rich countries have more internet access, their population is more educated, and urbanised (you can see this by how different colours are quite separated in the plots above, which I also find a nice by product of this analysis :)).\n  \nSo for example, it is temping to say that countries with higher urban population or with more people with [terciary education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_education) also have a higher kaggler density, however, these are properties of countries higher GDP, so it is hard to tell if urbanisation or higher education are driving kaggler density up or not.\n\nBut one interesting question that comes from these plots is: given that countries from different income levels actually have different characteristics (rich -> more internet, more cities, more educated labour force), **do we see any strong difference between kagglers from different income groups?**\n\n(this is inspired by the [Dollar Streat](https://www.gapminder.org/dollar-street/matrix) project , where one can see that despire cultural differences, people from similar incomes have very similar homes)\n\nLet's start with gender:\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"373d02cd734510f2d2d9798a24043fd1479a0801","_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"kaggle_by_incomegrp = kaggle_data.copy()\n\nfor i,k in pop['IncomeGroup'].to_dict().items():\n    kaggle_by_incomegrp.replace(to_replace={i:k},inplace=True)\nkaggle_by_incomegrp.replace({'I do not wish to disclose my location' : 'Not telling you'},inplace=True)\n    \nkaggle_by_incomegrp = kaggle_by_incomegrp[['Q3','Q1','Q2','Q4','Q8','Q9']]\nkaggle_by_incomegrp.columns = ['IncomeGroup','Gender','Age','Education','Experience','Compensation']\nkaggle_by_incomegrp.drop(index=0,inplace=True)\nfix_index = ['High\\n(OECD)', 'High\\n(nonOECD)', 'Upper\\nMiddle','Lower\\nMiddle', 'Other','Not telling you']\n\n#kaggle_by_incomegrp.describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"4b0e9ca57eaa8cf9e9e7b1d949f8fc992d807eda","_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def massage_data(feature):\n    feat = kaggle_by_incomegrp.groupby(['IncomeGroup',feature]).size().reset_index()\n    feat.columns = ['IncomeGroup',feature,'Counts']\n    feat.set_index('IncomeGroup')\n\n    # Change to percentage\n    feat['Percentage'] = np.nan\n    feature_nb = len(feat[feature].unique())\n    for i,grp in enumerate(feat['IncomeGroup'].unique()):\n        total = feat[feat['IncomeGroup'] == grp]['Counts'].sum()\n        idx = np.where(feat['IncomeGroup'] == grp)[0]\n        feat[idx[0]:idx[-1]+1]['Percentage'] = feat[idx[0]:idx[-1]+1]['Counts'] / total*100\n\n    return feat","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"8f96bd6e28405ae7f7262ba4f1d6d02a14e9b20a","_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"gender = massage_data('Gender')\n# pivot from here: https://pstblog.com/2016/10/04/stacked-charts\npivot_gender = gender.pivot(index='IncomeGroup', columns='Gender', values='Percentage').loc[fix_index]\np = pivot_gender.plot.bar(stacked=True, figsize=(10,7),cmap='Accent')\ndummy = p.set_ylabel('Percentage of total answers per income group')\ndummy = p.set_xlabel('')\ndummy = p.legend(loc='center left', bbox_to_anchor=(1, 0.5))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"cd34cd5eb50dfa06a067ed66a6ee832c85d877fa"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As you probably know by now, most kagglers identify as males, with less than ~20% identifying as females.

Notice how usually there about 50% of students in secondary education are female (second plot), although lower middle income countries still lag a tiny bit behind. \n\nThen, very interestingly, there are way more woman in industry in upper middle income countries than in any other category (third plot). Then, notice the nice progression of women entering the work force from lower middle income countries to high (from about 55% up to 80%). Interestingly, this is not mirrored in the first plot, this is, there are not more woman kagglers in high income countries than in lower.  \n\nSo, is women representation in kagglers representative of women representation in education and labour force in each income level?\n\nWe can have a look at the variance of the plots above, that will give us an idea of how much the different income levels differ:\n\n    Kagglers 1.73\n    Female in secondary education 1.33\n    Female in Industry 5.06\n    Female in the labor force 10.63\n    Female in labor force with terciary education 11.07\n\nAs you can see, **the variation of the percentage of women in the Kaggler survey per income level is quite smaller than the variation in women in work force or in work force with terciary education** (a probably start for a Data Scientist, I'd say!), so I would argue that the disparities seen in the different income levels in woman education or participation on the labor force, are not seen in the Kaggle comunity. \n\nIn other words, imagine you had four very, very large rooms. In one you'd put kagglers from high income countries, in another one kagglers from lower middle income countries, in the two other rooms just regular working people with high education from high and lower income contries. If you were to choose a person at random, you'd have almost the same chance of picking a female from both the kaggle rooms (18% to 15%, asuming the survey is representative). They are not that different. But if you were to do the same in the 'regular' folks room, you would be much less likelly to pick a female than a male in the lower income countries than in the higher ones. \n\nOk. what about age?"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"scrolled":false,"_uuid":"708b3e62122a155d7401d9ee9128adc4a7191822","_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"age = massage_data('Age')\npivot_age = age.pivot(index='IncomeGroup', columns='Age', values='Percentage').loc[fix_index]\np = pivot_age.plot.bar(stacked=True, figsize=(10,7),cmap='Blues_r',)\ndummy = p.set_ylabel('Percentage of total answers per income group')\ndummy = p.set_xlabel('')\ndummy = p.legend(loc='center left', bbox_to_anchor=(1, 0.5))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"6adc6ba00985fe30f43850bb1eb629739c504ed5"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now age is a different matter.

There is a clear trend of people not wanting to disclose their incomes with group income, with people from high income countries being more ok with sharing in a survey how much they earn.

Most people answering the Survey live in the United States, India and China. However, these countries have very large populations, so their kaggler density (survey answer per habitant) is relativelly low. Singapore, Ireland and Israel are the top countries with the highest density.\n2.  Most people that answered the survey live in 'Lower Middle Income' countries (according to World Development Indicator). However, this is also where most people live, so indeed the highest density of kagglers is found in high income countries.\n3. The percentage of female is quite low, but quite constant between the different income groups, even when diferences in percentage of women working and with higher education varied a lot between diferent income groups. I find that encoraging! If there are some barriers in access to higher education in some countries, it doesn't seem to see the case with access to kaggle :)\n4. Surveyed people from higher income countries were, generally, older than in the lower income group. However, this might only reflect the age distribution of the underlying population: countries in the lower income group have younger populations (although a direct comparision was not possible).\n5. In terms of education and experience, the 3 highest income groups are comparable, but the lower income group has slighly less experienced and less formally educated people. \n6. Compensation in lower incomes countries is, well, lower. However,  there is a higher percentage of data scientits in lower income countries that excedes (a) national income per capita.\n\nAll and all, looking at how diferent these 4 income groups can be in terms of GDP, urbanisation, education and equality, I think kagglers are still  a relativelly homogeneous group, with small(ish) differences in gender, experience and education. \n"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
