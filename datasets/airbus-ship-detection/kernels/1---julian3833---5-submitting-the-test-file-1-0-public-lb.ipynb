This is the fifth kernel of the series `Airbus Ship Detection Challenge - A quick overview for computer vision noobs.` This short and trivial kernel creates a 1.0 submission using the data shared by the Challenge organizers in response to the discovery of an important data leak.\n\n\nThe full series consist of the following notebooks:\n1. [Loading and visualizing the images](https://www.kaggle.com/julian3833/1-loading-and-visualizing-the-images)\n2. [Understanding and plotting rle bounding boxes](https://www.kaggle.com/julian3833/2-understanding-and-plotting-rle-bounding-boxes) \n3. [Basic exploratory analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/julian3833/3-basic-exploratory-analysis)\n4. [Exploring public models](https://www.kaggle.com/julian3833/4-exploring-models-shared-by-the-community)\n5. *[1.0 submission: submitting the test file](https://www.kaggle.com/julian3833/5-1-0-submission-submitting-the-test-file)*\n\nThis is an ongoing project, so expect more notebooks to be added to the series soon. Actually, we are currently working on the following ones:\n* Understanding and exploiting the data leak\n* A quick overview of image segmentation domain\n* Jumping into Pytorch\n* Understanding U-net\n* Proposing a simple improvement to U-net model"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"6c517aae87a0027dcdb835d3665867e1ea055fbf"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1.
