We're going to make you an offer you can't refuse: a Kaggle competition! In a
world... where movies made an estimated $41.7 billion in 2018, the film
industry is more popular than ever. But what movies make the most money at the
box office? How much does a director matter? Or the budget? For some movies,
it's "You had me at 'Hello.'" For others, the trailer falls short of
expectations and you think "What we have here is a failure to communicate." In
this competition, you're presented with metadata on over 7,000 past films from
The Movie Database to try and predict their overall worldwide box office
revenue. Data points provided include cast, crew, plot keywords, budget,
posters, release dates, languages, production companies, and countries. You
can collect other publicly available data to use in your model predictions,
but in the spirit of this competition, use only data that would have been
available before a movie's release. Join in, "make our day", and then "you've
got to ask yourself one question: 'Do I feel lucky?'"
