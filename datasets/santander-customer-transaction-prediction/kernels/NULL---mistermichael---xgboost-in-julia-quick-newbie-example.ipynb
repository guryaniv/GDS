Obviously, Kaggle does not have support for Julia yet, but I know there are some like me who are interested in the language and its current capabillities! \n\nFor those who may be interested in doing this competition with the language (whether seriously or whether to just try out *Julia*), here is a working example of XGBoost used in the Julia language. I managed to advance quite a bit in the leaderboard from my initial score using this code without adjusting that much about the model besides the number of rounds. \n\nObviously, this code has to be run in a Julia environment to see results... but I wanted to provide it here.

You'll notice that the code is pretty similar to Python or R as far as XGBoost is concerned. You'll also notice that I didn't do any feature engineering, EDA, etc. These are all reasonably able to be accomplished in Julia, but I haven't quite learned how to do all those things yet since I'm still attached at the hip to R!\n\nHopefully this code helps someone out who might be looking to play around with *Julia* ! Though I'll probably be sticking to R and Python for now since there's no real reason for me to switch, *Julia* is definitely on my radar.
