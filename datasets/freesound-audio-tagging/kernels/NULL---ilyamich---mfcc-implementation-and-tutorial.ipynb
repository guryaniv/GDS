The MFCC uses the MEL scale to divide the frequency band to sub-bands and then extracts the Cepstral Coefficents using Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). MEL scale is based on the way humans distinguish between frequencies which makes it very convenient to process sounds.\n\nLets first understand how humans perceive sounds.\n\n## Human voice sound perception\nAdult humans fundamental voice frequency range is between 85Hz to 255Hz (85Hz to 180Hz for male and 165Hz to 255Hz for female). On top of the fundamental frequency there are harmonics of fundamental frequencys. Harmonics are whole multiplications of the fundamental frequency. If for instance the fundamental frequency is 100Hz then its second harmonic will be 200Hz, third harmonic is 300Hz and so on.\n\nYou can see an example in the image below [1] which shows frequency vs. time of several pronounced words and color represents frequency power at that point (yellow strongest and black weakest):\n<img src=\"https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/media/sound/speechsep-audio/speechsep-2-spect.png\", width=600, height=200>\n\nNotice the first horizontal yellow line on the bottom of each segment. That is the fundamental frequency and its the strongest. Above that there are harmonics with the same frequncy distance from each other.\n\nHumans can hear roughly between 20Hz to 20KHz. The perception of sound is non-linear [2] and you can better distinguish between low frequency sounds than high frequency sounds e.g. humans can clearly hear the difference betwee 100Hz and 200Hz but not between 15kHz and 15.1kHz.\n\nYou can try in usin a tone generator: http://www.szynalski.com/tone-generator/\n\n## MEL scale\nA MEL scale is a unit of PITCH proposed by Stevens, Volkmann and Newmann in 1937. The MEL scale is a scale of pitches judged by listeners to be equal in distance one from another [3] [4]. Because of how humans perceive sound the MEL scale is a non-lenear scale and the distances between the pitches increeses with frequency.\n\n# MFCC implementation [5] [6]\n## Sample signal\nFirst, lets load a sample audio and start working with it:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"265ea35ffa699b36b3d48285dbac2252a4105d8b"},"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\nimport numpy as np\nimport scipy\nfrom scipy.io import wavfile\nimport scipy.fftpack as fft\nfrom scipy.signal import get_window\nimport IPython.display as ipd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n%matplotlib inline","execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false,"_uuid":"2c524ec720963ad1211d718c5d22009118861227"},"cell_type":"code","source":"TRAIN_PATH = '../input/audio_train/'\nipd.Audio(TRAIN_PATH + \"a439d172.wav\")","execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"scrolled":true,"trusted":false,"_uuid":"ccce924fe90f42438b42af7e85bfb565bd4fdb68"},"cell_type":"code","source":"sample_rate, audio = wavfile.read(TRAIN_PATH + \"a439d172.wav\")\nprint(\"Sample rate: {0}Hz\".format(sample_rate))\nprint(\"Audio duration: {0}s\".format(len(audio) / sample_rate))","execution_count":3,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"908f0dafc0a97eeaf316114110be8117f450be80"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Bonus: notice that the sample rate is 44.1kHz which is the standart sampling rate for audio files. This number is not a coincidence. Acording to Nyquist, that sampling rate of 44.1kHz give us band-width of 22.05kHz. The 0Hz to 22.05kHz zone is called the first Nyquist zone, 22.05kHz to 44.1kHz is the second Nyquist zone and so on. If there is a signal in the second Nyquist zone (lets say 22.1kHz) it will alias to the first Nyquist zone (22kHz in our case). We dont want this to happend so we add a low pass filter (LPF). All LPFs has a pass-band, stop-band and transition band. \n\n<img src=\"http://msp.ucsd.edu/techniques/v0.11/book-html/img855.png\", width=300, height=1>\n\nThe sampling frequency of 44.1kHz was chose so that the transition band will be from 20kHz (pass-band) to 22.05kHz (stop-band).
