The growing popularity and complexity of the models worsens the case. There is a trade-off between accuracy and interpretability.\n\n![](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/kasiainterpretablemachinelearning-171219021018/95/interpretable-machine-learning-using-lime-framework-kasia-kulma-phd-data-scientist-aviva-16-638.jpg?cb=1513658331)\n\nThere are some domains especially in the world of finance and healthcare where data scientists often end up having to use more traditional machine learning models (linear or tree-based). The reason being that model interpretability is very important for the business to explain each and every decision being taken by the model. However, this often leads to a sacrifice in performance. This is where complex models like ensembles and neural networks typically give us better and more accurate performance (since true relationships are rarely linear in nature). We, however, end up being unable to have proper interpretations for model decisions.I try to address this gap by using **model-agnostic methods**, which is independent of the model being used.\n\nThe question you might find yourself asking at this point of time is : ***\"Why do I need an interpretable model, I don't work in finance?\"***\n\n> **Human curiosity and Learning**- When you will show your magic-like model to someone, the first thing that person will ask is ,*How did it do this?* What are you gonna say , *I don't know, I just fed the input  to the model, tuned some hyperparameters and got this output*. OF COURSE NOT!\n\n> **Building Trust**- When you are selling your ML product to a prospective buyer , why should he trust your model? How can he know the model will produce good results under all circumstances? Interpretability is required to increase social acceptance of ML Models in our day-to-day lives.\n\n> **Debugging**- When you are trying to reason an unexpected result or finding a bug in your model, Interpretability becomes very useful.\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"012c1e6dcca4a57ad53f1218710c44f6285179fd"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"If you are not convinced yet , you can read a [story](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/storytime.html) to convince yourself."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"f93480ef68304e34d5a7457f83a2fb470ccd488a"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Interpretability is basically of 2 types:-\n\n* **Model Specific**-  Model-specific interpretation tools are very specific to intrinsic model interpretation methods which depend purely on the capabilities and features on a per-model basis. This can be coefficients, p-values, AIC scores pertaining to a regression model, rules from a decision tree and so on. The interpretation of regression weights in a linear model is a model-specific interpretation, since – by definition – the interpretation of intrinsically interpretable models is always model-specific. \n\n* **Model-Agnostic**- Model-agnostic tools can be used on any machine learning model and are applied after the model has been trained (post hoc). These agnostic methods usually work by analyzing feature input and output pairs. By definition, these methods cannot have access to model internals such as weights or structural information."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"c660006fe8159b3867b4c1bffb64dfa8d3a68be7"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In this kernel , we will focus on model-agnostic methods."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"3aebcd20d4627e96090585225f75c3f6de16855a"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"I'm using the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset for  classifying whether a person has diabetes or not based on some features.\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"47890a8c7d2cb2fd80be20e929961aa4e2dda8bb"},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport os\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split,GridSearchCV\nprint(os.listdir(\"../input\"))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"27a5a29b269193aa7b214a97d3d3c8041170a41d"},"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.set(style=\"white\", palette=\"colorblind\", font_scale=1.2, \n        rc={\"figure.figsize\":(12,9)})\nRANDOM_STATE = 420 # set everything for the plots\nN_JOBS=8","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"79506510a9c5c6d7e9bfd11a491dcc376340e809"},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv(\"../input/pima-indians-diabetes-database/diabetes.csv\")\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"4a83f84ca8eda15e680b2c337aebf1af0b226d7d"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's know our features:\n * *Pregnancies*- Number of past pregnancies of the patient\n * *Glucose* -  Plasma glucose concentration(mg/dL)\n * *Blood Pressure*- Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg\n * *Skin Thickness*- Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)\n * *Insulin*- 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)\n * *BMI*- Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)\n * *Diabetes Pedigree Function*-  It determines whether a trait has a dominant or recessive pattern of inheritance.It is calculated when a patient has a diabetes history in the family.\n * *Age*- Age (years)\n * *Outcome*- Whether a person has diabetes or not( 0=No, 1=Yes)\n \n Insulin helps a person to use glucose in the blood to release energy.

It leverages game theory to help measure the impact of the features on the predictions .A prediction can be explained by assuming that each feature value of the instance is a *“player”* in a game where the prediction is the *payout*. The Shapley value  tells us how to fairly distribute the “payout” among the features.\n\nPlayers? Game? Payout? What is the connection to machine learning predictions and interpretability? The “game” is the prediction task for a single instance of the dataset. The “gain” is the actual prediction for this instance minus the average prediction for all instances. The “players” are the feature values of the instance that collaborate to receive the gain (= predict a certain value).\n\nLet's understand this with an example:\n\n![](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/images/shapley-instance.png)\n\nYou have trained a machine learning model to predict apartment prices. For a certain apartment it predicts €300,000 and you need to explain this prediction. The apartment has a size of 50 m2, is located on the 2nd floor, has a park nearby and cats are banned.\n\nThe average prediction for all apartments is €310,000. How much has each feature value contributed to the prediction compared to the average prediction?\n\nThe answer could be: The park-nearby contributed €30,000; size-50 contributed €10,000; floor-2nd contributed €0; cat-banned contributed -€50,000. The contributions add up to -€10,000, the final prediction minus the average predicted apartment price.\n\nNow you must be thinking ,how do we calculate the Shapley value for one feature?\n\nThe Shapley value is the average marginal contribution of a feature value across all possible coalitions. Coalitions are nothing but different simulated environments created by varying the feature and noticing the effect. For example if everything is kept the same and \" cat-banned\" is changed to \"cat-allowed\" , we check how the prediction changed. For more info , you can read [this](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/shapley.html).\n\nThis is taken from DanB's tutorial kernel.Let's do this for the 7th instance in our dataset."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"3f9f059585eea81e77b2f0fa200caaa44cff5d21"},"cell_type":"code","source":"import shap\n\n# create our SHAP explainer\nshap_explainer = shap.TreeExplainer(estimator)\n# calculate the shapley values for our data\nshap_values = shap_explainer.shap_values(X_train.iloc[7])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"d9f2e624d2adf5e47e1b701203fb423a5cc3feea"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# load JS in order to use some of the plotting functions from the shap\n# package in the notebook\nshap.initjs()\nshap.force_plot(shap_explainer.expected_value[1], shap_values[1], X_train.iloc[7])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"eb08255eae89b90a5b3139325373fe4f92d1c66b"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Features causing increase in prediction are in pink and features causing a decrease in prediction is in blue, along with their value showing the magnitude of effect.
