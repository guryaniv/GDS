Housing costs demand a significant investment from both consumers and
developers. And when it comes to planning a budget—whether personal or
corporate—the last thing anyone needs is uncertainty about one of their
biggets expenses. Sberbank, Russia’s oldest and largest bank, helps their
customers by making predictions about realty prices so renters, developers,
and lenders are more confident when they sign a lease or purchase a building.
Although the housing market is relatively stable in Russia, the country’s
volatile economy makes forecasting prices as a function of apartment
characteristics a unique challenge. Complex interactions between housing
features such as number of bedrooms and location are enough to make pricing
predictions complicated. Adding an unstable economy to the mix means Sberbank
and their customers need more than simple regression models in their arsenal.
In this competition, Sberbank is challenging Kagglers to develop algorithms
which use a broad spectrum of features to predict realty prices. Competitors
will rely on a rich dataset that includes housing data and macroeconomic
patterns. An accurate forecasting model will allow Sberbank to provide more
certainty to their customers in an uncertain economy.
