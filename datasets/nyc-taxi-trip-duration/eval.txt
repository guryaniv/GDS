The evaluation metric for this competition is Root Mean Squared Logarithmic
Error. The RMSLE is calculated as ϵ= √ 1 n n ∑ i=1 (log(pi+1)−log(ai+1))2
Where: ϵ is the RMSLE value (score) n is the total number of observations in
the (public/private) data set, pi is your prediction of trip duration, and ai
is the actual trip duration for i . log(x) is the natural logarithm of x
Submission File For every row in the dataset, submission files should contain
two columns: id and trip_duration. The id corresponds to the column of that id
in the test.csv. The file should contain a header and have the following
format: id,trip_duration id00001,978 id00002,978 id00003,978 id00004,978 etc.
