This may mean that the features are composition of one-hot encoded categorical data and/or time series data. The reason I assume that the data may contain one-hot encoded categorical data is because the data is very sparse and it may probably be because categorical values are one-hot encoded. Not only that it may also mean that the data is time series data which probably contains **each** customer's transactions with the bank over *x* number of years/months. Most financial datasets would include some sort of record of over a period of timeframe for **each** customer which will be useful for some sort of predictions (credit worthiness, future transactions, etc).\n\nThis is my initial assumption."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"847a199ebc78f32d1f653b8edfa409206f0a151b","collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np","execution_count":49,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"ded0329a11f29298255343c7f6332f9f555e697c"},"cell_type":"code","source":"train = pd.read_csv('../input/train.csv')\ntest = pd.read_csv('../input/test.csv')","execution_count":50,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"68f63d069a4dcb4c75481293ceb8b78693da43ec"},"cell_type":"code","source":"target = train['target'].values","execution_count":51,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"2aae64554f20a966a5cff4b7a54e42f3150f6323"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Datatypes"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"b5fec34e4ceb5ede7bab470b6d50a91476192710"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In training dataset, 3147 features are int64 but there are no int64 datatype in testing dataset.
