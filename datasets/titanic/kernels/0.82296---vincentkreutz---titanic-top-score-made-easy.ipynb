Common mistake\n\nI had a lot of fun exploring the Titanic dataset and felt like an investigator in charge of discovering the reasons why some people survived and other died. I think that this competition is a great way to start learning but teaches you the harsh way !  Indeed, as most of us, I first blindly applied my favorite classification algorithm, that is Random Forest, barely looking at the features. I was mainly focused on tweaking hyperparameters and designing very complex strategies to fill in missing values for Age, Fare, Embarked... I could not overtop the 79-80% of the top 20% of participants. \n \n ### 2. Simple is beautiful\n \nUntil I accidentally discovered that some people in the test set shared family bounds with people in the train set. Everything became clear at that moment. I finally understood that it did not matter if you were 35 or 40 or if you paid 12£ instead of 20£. What really matters here is the fate of people whom you were travelling with. Indeed, in all this chaos, what prevailed was bounds between passengers.\n\n### 3. Build a transparent model\n\nSo the challenge is to properly identify people who were travelling together and decide on the fate of people in the test set given what happened to the people in the train set that belonged to the same group. **We then build here our own decision tree that is a transparent model that we fully understand. **\n \nThus I want to insist on a particular point of interest that contradicts what we usually learn doing Machine Learning that we should not use any information on the test set while building our model. If we follow this principle here and run classical algorithms on the training set, they won't be able to see the connections that could exist between the training and test sets. As you could have noticed, by naively training classification algorithms, they often output that all men died. Slightly better, they output that all youg Masters survived even if they have mothers who died in the training set.  That is why we should manually correct them or simply don't use them here as the most important features are neither quantitative nor categorical as Name or Ticket.

I did not manage yet to do the same as I did for single women. That is finding a good, balanced training set to train a classification algo that would output very high survival probability for men in the test set that are not young Masters. \n\nMoreover, many operations in this notebook are done manually. I could improve it by creating real column features as for Mother, Father, Mother who died, Mother who Survived, Mean of Survival for People in the same group... Then feed those new features to a classification algorithm. \n\nBesided, more could be done also on the Name feature to extract the nationality of passengers. As we saw, some people travelled together, not sharing any family bounds based on family names, and shared the same fate. From the training data, we could aslo extrapolate the fact that non-english speaking passengers could be more likely to die. \n\n**I would be happy if some Kagglers forked this notebook and improve from it. I Welcome also all your comments to improve this code and I will add some comments if some operations were not clear enough.**"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"45a168a08509426bf051f8188fac5f2f859ef70f"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h2><a id=C>Checks </a>"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"a0b0ac2088e163d9dc653780118e9869eb529314"},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"Men who are predicted to survive\")\ndftest[(dftest[\"Survived\"]==1)& (dftest[\"Sex\"]==\"male\")]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"4798478885610925a7e4fb16807de20d77c323a6"},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"Women who are predicted to survive\")\ndftest[(dftest[\"Survived\"]==0)& (dftest[\"Sex\"]==\"female\")]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"79f7fd356175105f3da2e2dbae9d327214fc47d7"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h2><a id=CSV>CSV OUTPUT </a>"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"606050c5d4e2ee08848bef1a247f6c6c5b6e5e21"},"cell_type":"code","source":"dftest_sorted=dftest.sort_values(\"PassengerId\")\ndftest_sorted=dftest_sorted[[\"PassengerId\",\"Survived\"]]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"12a84641df8eb76b3cff4fa77048f085f669580f"},"cell_type":"code","source":"dftest_sorted.to_csv(\"Titanic.csv\",index=False)\nprint('print csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
