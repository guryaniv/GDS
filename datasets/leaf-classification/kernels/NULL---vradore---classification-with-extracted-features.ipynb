The data contains three files of pre-extracted feature vectors used in the published paper. The data also contains black and white leaf images which allows feature extraction for model building.\n### I will first prepare the pre-extracted features and use them as a benchmark in model building. \n### I will mainly focus on extracting features from the images and test whether and how they can be used for model building.\n### Although this project didn't use the data on kaggle, it is highly related to the classification task assigned here. I upload my notebook here in case that you are interested. \n### Comments are welcomed.\n###https://github.com/vradore/python_data/blob/master/UCI_plant_leaves/species_classification_MGu_final.ipynb", "outputs": [], "cell_type": "markdown", "execution_count": null}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"version": "3.6.1", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"version": 3, "name": "ipython"}, "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py", "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "name": "python"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 2}
