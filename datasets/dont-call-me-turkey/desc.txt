Hungry for a new competition? Give thanks for this opportunity to avoid those
awkward family political dinner discussions and endless holiday movie
marathons over the Thanksgiving break. Spend time with your Kaggle family
instead to find the real turkey! In this competition you are tasked with
finding the turkey sound signature from pre-extracted audio features. A simple
binary problem, or is it? What does a turkey really sound like? How many
sounds are similar? Will you be able to find the turkey or will you go a-fowl?
This is a short, fun, holiday, playground competition. Please, do not ruin the
fun for yourself and for everyone by using a model trained on the answers.
Don't be a turkey!
